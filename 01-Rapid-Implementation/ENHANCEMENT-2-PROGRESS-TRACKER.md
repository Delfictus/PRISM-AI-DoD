## Spatial Entropy with Real Pixel Processing

**Started:** January 9, 2025
**Target Completion:** January 10, 2025 (1.5 days)
**Status:** ⏳ READY TO BEGIN
**Governance:** ACTIVE

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Enhancement Objective
Replace spatial entropy placeholder (0.5) with real Shannon entropy computation from pixel data, making platform ready for operational SDA sensor feeds.

### Strategic Importance
- **Article II Compliance:** Enhanced spatial pattern analysis
- **Operational Readiness:** Platform accepts real 1024×1024×u16 IR sensor data
- **SBIR Proposal:** Demonstrates production-level thinking
- **Performance:** Minimal impact (+40μs, still <1ms total)

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Real Shannon entropy computed from pixel data
- [ ] Platform accepts 1024×1024×u16 format (SDA standard)
- [ ] Backward compatible (existing demos work)
- [ ] All tests passing (existing + 6 new)
- [ ] Performance: <50ms overhead for pixel processing
- [ ] Article II compliance improved
