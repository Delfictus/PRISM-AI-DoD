## WHERE "PHASE II MONTHS 4-6" IS LOCATED

**Answer:** **NOWHERE YET** - This is the FUTURE SBIR execution timeline!

**It's referenced in:**
- `TECHNICAL-DEBT-INVENTORY.md` - As future work timeline
- `HIGH-PRIORITY-ENHANCEMENTS-TODO.md` - Target date for enhancements
- `ENHANCEMENT-1-COMPLETION.md` - When to train ML model

**Why it's referenced:**
- To plan when enhancements will be implemented
- To inform SBIR proposal (what happens in Phase II)
- To show roadmap to reviewers

**Current reality:**
- We are in **30-day sprint** (pre-award preparation)
- Week 1-2: ✅ Complete
- Week 3-4: ⏳ Next (proposal writing + demos)
- SBIR Phase II: Starts after award (estimated April 2025)

## TERMINOLOGY MAPPING

### Current Work (Now - January 2025)
```
30-Day Sprint = Proposal Preparation Period
├── Week 1 (Days 1-7)   ✅ COMPLETE - Core infrastructure
├── Week 2 (Days 8-14)  ✅ COMPLETE - Enhancements
├── Week 3 (Days 15-21) ⏳ NEXT - SBIR proposal writing
└── Week 4 (Days 22-30) ⏳ FUTURE - Demos & submission
```

### Future Work (Post-Award - April 2025+)
```

├── Months 1-3:  Deploy v1.0, operational testing
├── Months 4-6:  ML enhancements (Items 1-3)  ← HERE
├── Months 7-9:  BMC3 integration, real telemetry
└── Months 10-12: Scaling, transition to Phase III
```

---

## WHAT TO DO NOW

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 3)
**Days 15-21:** Write SBIR Proposal

**NOT:**
- ❌ Don't implement Phase II Month 4-6 work now
- ❌ Don't train ML model now (no need yet)
- ❌ Don't wait for SBIR award

**YES:**
- ✅ Write proposal describing what will happen in Phase II
- ✅ Use Enhancement 1 framework as proof of concept
- ✅ Show roadmap (Months 1-12) in proposal
- ✅ Demonstrate v1.0 working system

### Enhancement 1 Status: ✅ FRAMEWORK COMPLETE

**What's done:**
- ✅ Architecture designed
- ✅ Code implemented (550+ lines)
- ✅ Tests written (7 tests)
- ✅ Integration ready
- ✅ Synthetic data generator working

**What's deferred to Phase II Month 4-5:**
- ⏸️ Train on large dataset (100K+ samples)
- ⏸️ Train on operational data (from SDA)
- ⏸️ Deploy trained model to production
- ⏸️ A/B test vs heuristic

**Why defer:**
- Don't need trained model for proposal
- Framework demonstrates capability
- Training happens after award (access to real data)
- Proposal shows plan, not final product

   - Constitutional AI (unique innovation)

3. Phase II Work Plan  ← HERE IS WHERE "PHASE II MONTHS" GOES
   Months 1-3: Deploy v1.0
   Months 4-6: ML enhancements (show Enhancement 1 framework)
   Months 7-9: BMC3 integration
   Months 10-12: Scaling

4. Innovation
   - Constitutional framework
   - Transfer entropy
   - GPU isolation

5. Risk Mitigation
   - v1.0 working (low risk)
   - Enhancements optional (not required)
```

**Cost Volume:**
```
- Labor: $800K-1M (12 months, 2-3 engineers)
- Equipment: $200K (GPUs, servers)
- Travel: $50K (demos, meetings)
- Overhead: $450K-750K
Total: $1.5-2M
```

## ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION

### "Where is Phase 2 located in the plan?"

**Answer:** Phase II (SBIR contract execution) is **IN THE FUTURE** - it starts AFTER the award.

**References to "Phase II Months X-Y" in vault mean:**
- Future work that will happen if/when SBIR is awarded
- Timeline for the 12-month contract period
- Planned in proposal, executed post-award

**Current position:**
- ✅ Week 1-2: COMPLETE (technical work)
- ⏳ Week 3: NEXT (write proposal describing what Phase II will do)
- ⏳ Week 4: FUTURE (demos showing what's already working)
- ⏳ Phase II: AFTER AWARD (execute the 12-month plan)

**Enhancement 1 framework:**
- Built NOW (shows capability)
- Described in proposal (what we'll do in Phase II Months 4-6)
- Actually trained/deployed LATER (when Phase II funded)

---

## RECOMMENDATION

### For Week 3 (Days 15-21)

**Write SBIR Proposal That Says:**

> "PRISM-AI has developed a production-ready PWSA data fusion platform (v1.0) with <1ms latency and zero-trust security. The platform is operational with validated heuristic algorithms. In Phase II Months 4-6, we will enhance the system with ML-based classifiers (architecture already implemented), spatial entropy computation, and multi-frame tracking. This phased approach enables immediate deployment (Months 1-3) while pursuing continuous improvement."

**Include:**
- Architecture diagrams (showing ML classifier design)
- Enhancement 1 code (proof we can do it)
- Timeline (Months 1-12 work breakdown)
- Budget (justify $1.5-2M over 12 months)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Train ML model now (not needed for proposal)
- ❌ Implement all enhancements now (describe in proposal)
- ❌ Wait for Phase II to start (it's months away)

---

**BOTTOM LINE:**

**Current Sprint:** Days 1-30 (proposal preparation)
- ✅ Days 1-14: DONE (technical work)
- ⏳ Days 15-21: NEXT (write proposal)
- ⏳ Days 22-30: FUTURE (demos)

**Phase II:** Months 1-12 (contract execution)
- Starts: After award (April 2025 estimated)
- Enhancements: Months 4-6
- Currently: Planning phase only

**Where you are:** ✅ **Ready to start Week 3 (proposal writing)**
