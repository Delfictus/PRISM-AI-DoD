## Daily Progress Summary

### ✅ DAY 8: Real Transfer Entropy Implementation (COMPLETE)
**Date:** January 9, 2025
**Focus:** Article III Constitutional Compliance Fix

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Task 1: Added TimeSeriesBuffer to PwsaFusionPlatform
- [x] Task 2: Wired up existing TransferEntropy module
- [x] Task 3: Replaced placeholder TE with real computation
- [x] Task 4: Created transfer entropy validation tests
- [x] Task 5: Verified Article III compliance

**Implementation Details:**
```
Files Modified:
- src/pwsa/satellite_adapters.rs (+150 lines)
  - Added TimeSeriesBuffer struct with VecDeque
  - Added history_buffer and te_calculator fields
  - Implemented compute_cross_layer_coupling_real()
  - compute_cross_layer_coupling_fallback() for warmup

Files Created:
- tests/pwsa_transfer_entropy_test.rs (200+ lines)
  - 5 comprehensive test cases
  - Validates TE warmup behavior
  - Tests coupling detection
  - Validates matrix properties
```

**Governance Validation:**
- ✅ Article III: Now uses REAL transfer entropy (no placeholders)
- ✅ All 6 directional TE pairs computed from time-series
- ✅ Minimum 20 samples required for statistical validity
- ✅ Fallback to heuristic during initial warmup only

**Technical Achievement:**
- Transfer entropy computation: Using proven algorithm from `/src/information_theory/transfer_entropy.rs`
- Time-series buffer: 100-sample sliding window (10 seconds at 10Hz)
- TE parameters: embedding_dim=3, lag=1 for optimal causal detection
- Asymmetric coupling: TE(i→j) ≠ TE(j→i) properly handled
