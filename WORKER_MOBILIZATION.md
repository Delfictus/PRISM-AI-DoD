# ðŸš¨ ALL WORKERS: MOBILIZATION DIRECTIVE

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: ALL WORKERS MOBILIZED
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Coordination Hub

### PRIMARY REFERENCE: GitHub Issue #15

**Issue #15** is the main coordination hub containing:
- Latest command comment with specific directives
- Cross-worker coordination updates
- Current status of all workers
- Integration dependencies

---

## Instructions for All Workers

### Step 1: Check Issue #15
Navigate to GitHub Issue #15 and read the **latest command comment** for:
- Overall coordination status
- Current phase/sprint information
- Cross-worker dependencies
- Latest strategic directives

### Step 2: Find Your Assigned Issue
Each worker has been assigned a specific GitHub issue number:
- Check Issue #15 for your assigned issue number
- Navigate to your assigned issue for worker-specific tasks
- Review task priorities and dependencies

### Step 3: Begin Work Immediately
- Start working on assigned tasks without delay
- Check your worker directory for `WORKER_DIRECTIVE.md`
- Follow constitutional compliance (Article I-IV)
- Coordinate via Issue #15 comments

## Constitutional Compliance Reminder

All workers must adhere to the Implementation Constitution:

### Article I: Thermodynamics
- Energy conservation mandatory
- Entropy non-decreasing
- Physics-based optimization

### Article II: GPU Acceleration
- >80% GPU utilization target
- Kernel optimization required
- Memory coalescence enforced

### Article III: Testing
- 95%+ coverage required
- Integration tests mandatory
- Validation against benchmarks

### Article IV: Active Inference
- Free energy minimization
- Bayesian state estimation
- Predictive coding architecture

## Communication Protocol

1. **Primary**: GitHub Issue #15 (latest comment)
2. **Worker-Specific**: Individual assigned issues
3. **Deliverables**: Post to `deliverables` branch
4. **Coordination**: Worker 0-Alpha/0-Beta manage integration

---

## Immediate Action Required

âœ… **All workers**: Check Issue #15 NOW
âœ… **All workers**: Find your assigned issue number
âœ… **All workers**: Begin work immediately

**This is not a drill. All workers are expected to start immediately.**
