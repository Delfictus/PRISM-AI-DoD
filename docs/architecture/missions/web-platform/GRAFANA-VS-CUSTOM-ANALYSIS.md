## WHERE GRAFANA APPEARS IN CURRENT PLAN

### Reference in WEB-PLATFORM-CONSTITUTION.md

**Line ~830:**
```yaml
# monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "title": "Web Platform Governance Dashboard",
    "panels": [
      {
        "title": "WebSocket Latency",
        "targets": [{"expr": "histogram_quantile(0.95, web_platform_websocket_latency_ms)"}]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Purpose:** Backend performance monitoring (developers, not stakeholders)

### Reference in GOVERNANCE-ENGINE.md

**Prometheus metrics collection:**
```rust
// backend/src/monitoring/metrics.rs
use prometheus::{register_histogram, register_counter};

lazy_static! {
    pub static ref WEBSOCKET_LATENCY: Histogram = register_histogram!(
        "web_platform_websocket_latency_ms",
        "WebSocket message processing latency"
    ).unwrap();
}

// Exported to Prometheus
// Visualized in Grafana
```

**Purpose:** Real-time monitoring during development and production

   - **Not ideal for 24/7 ops** (designed for demos, not monitoring)
   - **No built-in alerting** (would need to add)
   - **No historical analysis** (focuses on real-time)

---

### Grafana (Operational Monitoring)

#### Pros ✅

1. **Quick Setup**
   - **1-2 days** to get basic dashboards
   - **Pre-built panels** (gauges, graphs, heatmaps)
   - **Large library** of plugins
   - **Battle-tested** (used by millions)

2. **Powerful Features**
   - **Ad-hoc queries** (explore data freely)
   - **Alerting** (PagerDuty, Slack, email)
   - **Historical data** (InfluxDB, Prometheus)
   - **Annotations** (mark events)
   - **Variables** (filter by satellite, time range, etc.)

3. **Production-Grade**
   - **High availability** (clustering)
   - **Access control** (RBAC)
   - **Audit logging** (who viewed what)
   - **API** (programmatic access)

4. **Zero Maintenance**
   - **Open source** (free)

#### Cons ❌

1. **Generic Appearance**
   - **Not customizable enough** for stakeholder demos
   - **Looks like Grafana** (not unique/branded)
   - **Generic panels** (gauges, graphs - not 3D globe)
   - **Not impressive visually** (functional, not beautiful)

2. **Limited Interactivity**
   - **No custom interactions** (can't click satellites for details)
   - **No simulations** (can't right-click to fail nodes)
   - **No 3D visualizations** (no globe, no network topology)
   - **Read-only** (can't trigger scenarios)

3. **Single Domain**
   - **Designed for metrics** (not multi-domain storytelling)
   - **Time-series focused** (not spatial or network data)
   - **Can't show:** Transfer entropy matrix, constitutional compliance, 8-phase pipeline

4. **Not Demo-Friendly**
   - **Too technical** (for engineers, not executives)
   - **No scenario library** (just live data)
   - **Learning curve** (PromQL queries)
   - **Not presentation-quality** (operational, not polished)

---

## USE CASE COMPARISON

### Custom React Dashboards - BEST FOR:

**✅ SBIR Demonstrations**
- Live demo to SDA reviewers
- Executive presentations
- Stakeholder engagement
- Marketing materials

**Example Scenario:**
> You're presenting to SDA program manager. You show 3D globe with satellites, click "Hypersonic Threat Scenario", watch threat appear over Korean peninsula, see <1ms detection, read mission awareness recommendations. Manager is impressed by visuals and real-time capability.

**Grafana would NOT work for this** (too technical, not visually impressive)

---

### Grafana - BEST FOR:

**✅ Operational Monitoring**
- Development team tracking build times
- DevOps monitoring WebSocket performance
- On-call engineers getting alerted
- Post-mortem analysis (what happened 3 days ago?)

**Example Scenario:**
> Backend developer notices WebSocket latency spiking. Opens Grafana, sees p95 latency went from 50ms to 150ms at 14:32. Drills down to see it correlates with GPU memory pressure. Uses historical data to identify pattern. Sets up alert for future.

**Custom dashboards would NOT work for this** (no historical data, no ad-hoc queries)

---

---

## DETAILED SCENARIO COMPARISON

### Scenario 1: SBIR Proposal Demonstration

**Requirement:** Impress DoD reviewers with live demo

**Option A: Custom React Dashboard**
```
✅ 3D globe with satellites
✅ Click "Hypersonic Threat" scenario
✅ Watch threat appear with pulsing red marker
✅ See mission awareness: "ALERT INDOPACOM"
✅ Transfer entropy matrix lights up
✅ Beautiful animations, smooth 60fps

Reviewer reaction: "Wow, impressive. This is production-quality."
Win probability impact: +10-15 points
```

**Option B: Grafana**
```
❌ Show time-series graphs of telemetry
❌ No 3D visualization (just 2D plots)
❌ Click through multiple dashboards to see different metrics
❌ Looks like standard monitoring tool
❌ No dramatic threat visualization

Reviewer reaction: "Okay, this looks like any other monitoring system."
Win probability impact: 0 points (neutral)
```

**Winner:** ✅ **Custom React** (no contest for demos)

---

### Scenario 2: Production System Monitoring

**Requirement:** Monitor live PWSA system in operations (Phase II)

**Option A: Custom React Dashboard**
```
⚠️ Shows real-time data (good)
⚠️ No historical queries (can't ask "what was latency 3 days ago?")
⚠️ No alerts (no PagerDuty integration)
⚠️ Limited metrics (only what we pre-built)
⚠️ Requires code changes to add new metrics

Operations team reaction: "This is pretty but not useful for ops."
Operational value: Low
```

**Option B: Grafana**
```
✅ Historical queries (last 30 days of data)
✅ Alerting (PagerDuty if latency >100ms)
✅ Unlimited metrics (add any Prometheus metric)
✅ Ad-hoc analysis (custom PromQL queries)
✅ Quick iteration (no code needed)

Operations team reaction: "Perfect, this is exactly what we need."
Operational value: High
```

**Winner:** ✅ **Grafana** (no contest for ops)

---

### Scenario 3: Developer Debugging Performance Issue

**Requirement:** WebSocket latency spiked to 200ms, need to find why

**Option A: Custom React Dashboard**
```
❌ Shows current latency: 200ms
❌ Can't see historical data (when did it start?)
❌ Can't correlate with other metrics (GPU? CPU? Network?)
❌ Can't drill down into specific WebSocket connections
❌ Would need to add custom debugging panels

Developer: "I need more data. This doesn't help debug."
Debug time: 4+ hours (guessing)
```

**Option B: Grafana**
```
✅ Show latency graph over last 24 hours (started at 14:32)
✅ Overlay GPU memory graph (spiked at same time)
✅ Drill down to per-connection latency (PWSA channel slow)
✅ See logs in Loki (correlated with data)
✅ Identify root cause in 10 minutes

Developer: "Found it - GPU memory pressure causing swap."
Debug time: 10 minutes
```

**Winner:** ✅ **Grafana** (invaluable for debugging)

---

## RECOMMENDATION: USE BOTH
