**Market Position**:
- LLM: Ready to launch (Month 5)

- Financial: Pilot programs (Month 6)
- Robotics: Research partnerships (Month 7)

**What You WON'T Have** (without more time):
- Deep domain expertise in each area
- Large trained models (would need more compute/data)
- All possible applications (too many)
- Perfect optimization (ongoing work)

---

## IS THIS REASONABLE?

**YES - if you have**:
- 3 full-time experienced developers
- $500K-$1M budget (salaries + compute)
- Clear prioritization
- Good coordination

**NO - if**:
- Part-time developers (would take 12+ months)
- Inexperienced team (would take 2x time)
- Poor coordination (conflicts waste time)

**My Recommendation**:
This IS achievable with 3 skilled full-time developers in 4 months.

**Biggest Risks**:
1. GNN training (needs GPUs + data)
2. Domain expertise (drug/finance/robotics)
3. Integration complexity
4. Testing all combinations

**Mitigation**:
- Hire with domain expertise
- Start with synthetic data
- Daily integration
- Automated testing

**This plan is ambitious but feasible with the right team.**
