# PRISM-AI Integration Quick Start
**Phase 2 â†’ Full Integration** | October 14, 2025
**Model**: Hybrid (Specialized AI Workers + Human Coordinator)

---

## TL;DR - What You Need To Know

**Current Status**: Phase 2 (97% complete)
**Next Step**: Start integration orchestrator
**Automation Level**: 70% automated
**Your Role**: Message bus between 8 specialized Claude Code instances
**Your Time**: ~2 hours/day coordination over 18 days (~33 hours total)
**Manual Steps**: Coordinate workers, API keys (Phase 4), Production approval (Phase 6)

---

## Single Command To Start Everything

```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh
```

**That's it.** The orchestrator handles all 6 phases automatically.

---

## Understanding "Workers" = Claude Code AI Instances

**Important**: Workers are NOT humans. They are **separate Claude Code AI instances** running in different terminal windows.

- Each worker has deep domain expertise from Phase 1-2 development
- You (human) coordinate between them by switching terminals
- Workers wait for your prompts, then resolve issues using their specialization
- This preserves critical domain knowledge (LSTM 50-100Ã— speedup, GPU 80%+ utilization, etc.)

---

## Terminal Setup (10 Windows)

**Terminal 1: Worker 0-Alpha (Integration Orchestrator)**
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
# YOU prompt this Claude instance: "Start the integration orchestrator"
```

**Terminal 2-9: Workers 1-8 (Specialized Domains)**
```
Terminal 2: Worker 1 - Time Series/LSTM (pwd: PRISM-Worker-1)
Terminal 3: Worker 2 - GPU Infrastructure (pwd: PRISM-Worker-2)
Terminal 4: Worker 3 - PWSA/Applications (pwd: PRISM-Worker-3)
Terminal 5: Worker 4 - Finance/GNN (pwd: PRISM-Worker-4)
Terminal 6: Worker 5 - Mission Charlie (pwd: PRISM-Worker-5)
Terminal 7: Worker 6 - LLM Advanced (pwd: PRISM-Worker-6)
Terminal 8: Worker 7 - Drug Discovery/QA (pwd: PRISM-Worker-7)
Terminal 9: Worker 8 - API/Deployment (pwd: PRISM-Worker-8)
```

**Terminal 10: Dashboard Monitor (Manual Watch)**
```bash
watch -n 30 cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/INTEGRATION_DASHBOARD.md
```

**Workers do NOT run `watch` commands** - they wait for your prompts when orchestrator pauses.

## Hybrid Coordination Model

### What Runs Automatically (70%)

âœ… Orchestrator (Worker 0-Alpha) handles:
- Merge all worker branches
- Run builds after each merge
- Run integration tests
- Validate performance benchmarks
- Create notification files when issues arise
- Update dashboard in real-time
- Log everything

### What You Do Manually (30%)

ðŸŸ¡ **YOU** (human coordinator) handle:
- Monitor orchestrator output
- Read notification files when created
- Switch between terminal windows
- Prompt relevant Worker Claude instance with issue details
- Relay information between workers if needed
- Tell orchestrator to continue after resolution

**Time**: ~2 hours/day coordination (~33 hours over 18 days)

## Timeline (18 Days)

| Phase | Dates | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Phase 1** | Oct 13-14 | 8h | GPU infrastructure check |
| **Phase 2** | Oct 14-16 | 15h | Merge Worker 1 time-series |
| **Phase 3** | Oct 17-20 | 20h | Merge Workers 3, 4, 5 |
| **Phase 4** | Oct 21-23 | 15h | Configure API keys, merge Worker 6 |
| **Phase 5** | Oct 24-27 | 20h | Merge Workers 7, 8 |
| **Phase 6** | Oct 28-31 | 30h | Staging validation, production deploy |

**Total**: 108 hours over 18 days (Oct 13-31, 2025)

## Manual Steps Required

### Phase 4: Configure LLM API Keys (Worker 0-Alpha)

When orchestrator prompts:
```bash
# Set API keys in .env file
vim /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD/.env

# Add these keys:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
XAI_API_KEY=xai-...

# Test API keys
./test_api_keys.sh
```

Then type `yes` when orchestrator asks: "Have LLM API keys been configured?"

### Phase 6: Production Approval (Worker 7 + Worker 0-Alpha)

Worker 7 runs full validation:
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
git checkout staging
cargo test --all-features
cargo audit
./scripts/performance_validation.sh
```

Worker 0-Alpha approves production deployment based on Worker 7's validation report.

## Troubleshooting

### If orchestrator fails:
```bash
# Check dashboard
cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/INTEGRATION_DASHBOARD.md

# Check log for errors
tail -50 /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/integration_orchestrator.log

# Rollback last merge if needed
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh --rollback

# Restart from specific phase
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh --phase 3
```

### If worker notification isn't working:
```bash
# Manually check notification file
cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-X/NOTIFICATION.md

# Manually notify worker via Slack/email/phone
```

### If build fails:
```bash
# Check build output in log
grep "error\[" /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/integration_orchestrator.log

# Relevant worker fixes issue in their branch
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-X
# Fix issue
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Resolve build error"
git push origin worker-X-branch

# Worker 0-Alpha restarts orchestrator
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh --phase X
```

## Answer To Your Question

**Q**: "Do I need to activate all 8 workers telling them to review their workload instructions located in GitHub issues after I start the Worker 0-Alpha integration orchestrator?"

**A**: **NO - but you ARE the coordination layer.**

**Workers are Claude Code AI instances (not humans)**:
1. You start orchestrator in Terminal 1 (Worker 0-Alpha)
2. Workers 1-8 wait in their terminals (no automation)
3. When orchestrator hits an issue, it creates notification file
4. **YOU read the notification**
5. **YOU switch to relevant worker's terminal**
6. **YOU prompt that Worker Claude instance** to resolve the issue
7. **YOU switch back to orchestrator terminal**
8. **YOU tell orchestrator to continue**

**No GitHub issues required. Manual coordination required (you = message bus). 70% automated.**

**Why manual coordination?** Preserves specialized domain expertise each Claude instance built during Phase 1-2.

**Your time**: ~2 hours/day switching terminals and prompting workers (~33 hours total)
