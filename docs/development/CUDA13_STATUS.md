# CUDA 13 Setup Status Report

## Current Status
- **CUDA Toolkit 13.0**: ✅ Installed (`/usr/local/cuda-13.0/`)
- **NVCC 13.0**: ✅ Working (V13.0.88)
- **Compilation**: ✅ CUDA 13 code compiles successfully
- **Runtime**: ❌ Driver version mismatch

## Issue Detected
```
CUDA Runtime Version: 13.0
CUDA Driver Version: 12.8
Error: CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version
```

## Root Cause
Your NVIDIA driver (570.172.08) supports up to CUDA 12.8, but CUDA 13.0 requires driver version 575.x or newer.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Update NVIDIA Driver (Recommended)
```bash
# Check available drivers
ubuntu-drivers devices

# Install latest driver (>=575)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-575

# Or use the NVIDIA installer
# Download from: https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx
# Select: RTX 5070 / Linux 64-bit / Production Branch
```

### Option 2: Use CUDA 12.8 (Fallback)
If you can't update the driver immediately:
```bash
# Switch back to CUDA 12.8
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.8
export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

### Option 3: Use Docker with CUDA 13 (Alternative)
```bash
# Pull NVIDIA CUDA 13 container
docker pull nvidia/cuda:13.0-devel-ubuntu22.04

# Run with GPU support
docker run --gpus all -it nvidia/cuda:13.0-devel-ubuntu22.04
```

## Compatibility Matrix
| CUDA Version | Min Driver Version | Your Driver | Status |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| CUDA 12.8    | 570.x            | 570.172.08  | ✅ Compatible |
| CUDA 13.0    | 575.x            | 570.172.08  | ❌ Needs update |

## Next Steps
1. **Update NVIDIA driver to 575.x or newer**
2. Reboot system
3. Verify with `nvidia-smi`
4. Re-run CUDA 13 tests

## Temporary Workaround for PRISM-AI
Until driver is updated, the project will work with CUDA 12.8:
```bash
# Use this for now
source setup_cuda12.sh  # Create this file with CUDA 12.8 paths
cargo build --features cuda
cargo test --features cuda
```

## Performance Impact
- CUDA 12.8 vs 13.0: Minimal difference for most operations
- Your RTX 5070 will still deliver excellent performance
- CUDA 13 benefits: Improved memory management, better multi-GPU support
