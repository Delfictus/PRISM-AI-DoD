## üìù NOTES

### Domain Coordination (Approved):
- **Option C - Specialized Domain Split** approved by Worker 0
- Worker 3: Multi-domain breadth (basic finance)
- Worker 4: Deep solver + advanced finance (GPU-accelerated, quantitative)
- API structure: `/api/finance/basic/*` vs `/api/finance/advanced/*`

### Integration Status:
- ‚úÖ Worker 1 ‚Üí Workers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (Transfer Entropy, Active Inference, Time Series)
- ‚úÖ Worker 2 ‚Üí Workers 1, 3, 7 (GPU kernels)
