- Review Worker 0-Beta's weekly validation report
- Approve or reject `staging` ‚Üí `production` promotions
- Make strategic decisions on priorities and timeline

### 2. **Conflict Resolution**
- Handle complex merge conflicts Worker 0-Beta can't resolve
- Mediate between workers when needed
- Adjust priorities when workers are blocked

### 3. **Quality Gate**
- Final validation before production release
- Ensure SBIR/DoD requirements are met
- Manual testing of critical features (optional)

### 4. **Production Releases**
- Approve final production releases
- Tag releases with semantic versioning
- Coordinate with Worker 8 for deployment

---

## Daily Workflow

### Morning Check (Optional)
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-0-Alpha

# Check if Worker 0-Beta ran successfully last night
cat ../PRISM-Worker-0-Beta/integration-status.json

# Example output:
# {
#   "timestamp": "2025-10-12 18:00:00",
#   "build_status": "PASSED",
#   "test_status": "PASSED",
#   "merged_workers": ["worker-2-gpu-infra", "worker-1-ai-core", ...]
# }
```

### If Integration Failed
```bash
# Check logs
cat ../PRISM-Worker-0-Beta/integration-build.log

# Worker 0-Beta will have created GitHub issues
# Review issues and decide:
# - Is this blocking? (High priority)
# - Can other workers continue? (Normal priority)
# - Should we adjust timeline? (Strategic decision)
```

---

## Weekly Workflow

### Friday Afternoon - Review Weekly Report

**1. Worker 0-Beta Notification**
- You'll receive GitHub issue: "üì¶ Staging ready for production review"
- Contains validation summary and report link

**2. Review the Report**
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-0-Beta

# Read latest weekly report
cat weekly-report-week-*.md

# Example:
# Week 3 validation:
# ‚úÖ Release build PASSED
# ‚úÖ Tests PASSED
# ‚úÖ GPU validation PASSED
```

**3. Test Staging Branch (Optional)**
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-0-Alpha
git pull origin staging

cd 03-Source-Code

# Run your own validation if desired
cargo build --release --all-features
cargo test --all

# Test specific features manually
./target/release/test_gpu_kernel
./target/release/test_active_inference_gpu
```

**4. Make Decision**

**Option A: Approve Staging**
```bash
# Staging looks good, ready to consider for production
# Close the GitHub issue with comment:
# "‚úÖ Staging approved - ready for production consideration"

# No git action needed - staging already updated by Worker 0-Beta
```

**Option B: Request Changes**
```bash
# Issues found in staging
# Comment on GitHub issue:
# "‚ö†Ô∏è Issues found: <describe issues>
#  - Worker X needs to fix <specific problem>
#  - Will re-review next week"

# Optionally revert staging to previous state:
git reset --hard origin/staging~1
git push --force origin staging  # Use with caution!
```

## Production Release Process

### When to Release to Production

**Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ All 8 workers have completed major deliverables
- ‚úÖ Staging has passed multiple weeks of validation
- ‚úÖ SBIR/DoD requirements met
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete (Worker 8)
- ‚úÖ Deployment tested (Worker 8)

### Release Steps

**1. Final Validation**
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-0-Alpha

# Ensure staging is latest
git pull origin staging

# Run comprehensive tests
cd 03-Source-Code
cargo build --release --all-features
cargo test --all --all-features

# Optional: Run benchmarks
cargo bench --all-features
```

**2. Create Production Release**
```bash
# Switch to production branch
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
git checkout production
git pull origin production

# Merge staging
git merge staging -m "Production release v1.0.0 - SBIR Phase 1 deliverable"

# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "SBIR Phase 1 Deliverable

Major features:
- GPU-accelerated LLM orchestration
- Time series forecasting (PWSA, Finance, Robotics)
- Pixel-level processing (PWSA)
- Advanced thermodynamic consensus
- 52 GPU kernels operational
- Full API server and deployment infrastructure

Workers: 8
Total effort: ~2000 hours
Timeline: 7 weeks
"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin production
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**3. Notify All Workers**
```bash
# Create GitHub issue
gh issue create \
  --title "üöÄ Production Release v1.0.0 - SBIR Deliverable" \
  --body "Production release v1.0.0 has been deployed.

**Branch**: production
**Tag**: v1.0.0
**Date**: $(date)

## Deliverable Status
‚úÖ All 8 workers completed
‚úÖ 2030 hours total effort
‚úÖ 52 GPU kernels operational
‚úÖ Full SBIR Phase 1 requirements met

## Next Steps
1. Worker 8: Deploy to production environment
2. All workers: Review final documentation
3. Prepare Phase 2 proposal

**Thank you to all workers for the successful parallel development!**" \
  --label "production-release,milestone"
```

## Handling Blockers

### Scenario: Worker is Blocked by Dependency

**Example**: Worker 5 blocked, needs Worker 1's time series module

**Your Action**:
1. **Assess Impact**
   ```bash
   # Check deliverables log
   cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD/.worker-deliverables.log

   # See: Worker 1 time series is "IN PROGRESS"
   # Worker 5 is "BLOCKED"
   ```

2. **Strategic Decision**
   - Is Worker 1 close to completing? ‚Üí Wait
   - Is Worker 1 delayed? ‚Üí Prioritize Worker 1
   - Can Worker 5 work on something else? ‚Üí Suggest alternatives

3. **Communicate**
   ```bash
   # Comment on GitHub issue or create new one:
   # "Worker 5: While waiting for Worker 1, implement:
   #  - Replica exchange (no dependency)
   #  - Advanced energy functions
   #  - Bayesian learning
   # Expected: Worker 1 completes time series by end of Week 3"
   ```

### Scenario: Multiple Workers Have Merge Conflicts

**Your Action**:
1. **Review Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Check Worker 0-Beta logs
   cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-0-Beta/integration-build.log

   # See which files are conflicting
   ```

2. **Identify Root Cause**
   - Are workers editing shared files? ‚Üí Remind about file ownership
   - Is Worker 2 changing GPU interfaces? ‚Üí Coordinate with dependent workers
   - Complex architectural change? ‚Üí Call for coordination meeting

3. **Resolution Path**
   - Simple conflicts: Workers resolve individually
   - Complex conflicts: You may manually merge in staging
   - Architectural conflicts: Coordinate between workers

## Tools and Dashboards

### Integration Status Check
```bash
# Quick status of all workers
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
cat .worker-deliverables.log | grep "^##" -A 10

# Shows recent deliverables and blockers
```

### Build Health Check
```bash
# See if daily integration is passing
cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-0-Beta/integration-status.json | jq

# Example output:
# {
#   "timestamp": "2025-10-12 18:00:00",
#   "build_status": "PASSED",
#   "test_status": "PASSED",
#   "merged_workers": ["worker-2-gpu-infra", ...]
# }
```

### Worker Progress
```bash
# Check which workers have completed deliverables
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
cat DELIVERABLES.md | grep "^###"

# Shows each worker's deliverable status
```

---

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Build Failure

**Scenario**: Worker 0-Beta reports integration build failed for multiple days

**Your Action**:
1. **Assess Severity**
   ```bash
   # Check logs
   cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-0-Beta/integration-build.log

   # Is this blocking all workers? Or just one?
   ```

2. **Prioritize Fix**
   - If Worker 2 (GPU) failing ‚Üí **Critical** (blocks all)
   - If Worker 3 (apps) failing ‚Üí **Normal** (doesn't block others)

3. **Coordinate Fix**
   - Assign high priority to responsible worker
   - Consider temporarily reverting breaking commit
   - Daily check-in until resolved

### Timeline Slipping

**Scenario**: Week 4, but Worker 1 hasn't completed Week 3 deliverables

**Your Action**:
1. **Analyze Impact**
   - Who is blocked? (Worker 5, 7 waiting for time series)
   - Can they work on alternatives? (Yes - other features)

2. **Adjust Strategy**
   - Option A: Extend Worker 1's timeline, workers continue on alternatives
   - Option B: Reassign part of Worker 1's work
   - Option C: Accept reduced scope (drop some forecasting features)

3. **Communicate**
   - Update DELIVERABLES.md with new timeline
   - Notify affected workers
   - Adjust weekly review criteria

---

## Best Practices

### 1. **Trust Worker 0-Beta**
- Worker 0-Beta handles routine integration
- Only intervene when strategic decisions needed
- Review weekly reports, don't micromanage daily

### 2. **Clear Communication**
- Use GitHub issues for all decisions
- Document major decisions in INTEGRATION_PROTOCOL.md
- Keep workers informed of priority changes

### 3. **Balance Speed and Quality**
- Don't block progress for minor issues
- Critical issues (security, data loss): block immediately
- Documentation gaps: can fix later

### 4. **Empower Workers**
- Workers should resolve own conflicts when possible
- Provide guidance, not solutions
- Let Worker 0-Beta handle technical details
