# PRISM-AI Hybrid Coordination Guide
**Specialized AI Workers + Human Coordinator Model**

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Version**: 2.0 - Updated for Claude Code AI Workers
**Integration Phase**: Phase 2 (97% Complete) → Phase 6

---

## Understanding the Architecture

### What Are "Workers"?

**Workers are separate Claude Code AI instances**, each running in their own terminal window with:
- Dedicated working directory (worktree)
- Specialized branch (worker-X-branch)
- Deep domain expertise from Phase 1-2 development
- Context about their specific modules

**NOT human developers** - They are AI agents that you (the human) coordinate between.

### Why Keep 8 Specialized Workers for Integration?

During Phase 1-2 development, each worker built:
- ✅ Deep domain knowledge (LSTM, GPU, Finance, LLM, etc.)
- ✅ Understanding of performance requirements
- ✅ Context about architectural decisions
- ✅ Expertise in their module's code

**This specialization is CRITICAL for integration** because:
- Worker 1 knows why LSTM was designed that way (50-100× speedup)
- Worker 2 knows GPU kernel architecture (80%+ utilization)
- Worker 4 knows finance GNN implications (10-100× speedup)
- Worker 6 knows LLM routing logic (multi-provider caching)

**Losing this context = higher risk of breaking critical optimizations**

## Complete Workflow: Phase-by-Phase

### Phase 1: Start Orchestrator (One-Time Setup)

**Terminal 1 (Worker 0-Alpha)**:

YOU type/say to Claude:
```
"Start the integration orchestrator. Monitor for any conflicts or issues that require
specialized worker assistance. Pause and notify me if any worker-specific issues arise."
```

Worker 0-Alpha Claude runs:
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh
```

**Terminal 10 (Dashboard Monitor)**:

YOU run manually:
```bash
watch -n 30 cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/INTEGRATION_DASHBOARD.md
```

---

### Phase 2: Happy Path (No Issues)

**Orchestrator Output (Terminal 1)**:

# 🔔 Integration Notification

**Date**: 2025-10-17 14:30:22
**From**: Integration Orchestrator (Worker 8)

---

## Message

URGENT: Worker 4 merge conflict detected in Phase 3

Branch `worker-4-apps-domain2` has merge conflicts with deliverables.

**Conflict Details**:
File: 03-Source-Code/src/applications/finance/advanced_finance.rs
Lines: 145-167
Issue: Competing implementations between PWSA risk calculation (Worker 3)
       and GNN portfolio optimization (Worker 4)

**Required Action**:
1. Navigate to conflict file
2. Analyze both implementations
3. Integrate both or choose best approach
4. Ensure GNN 10-100× speedup preserved
5. Validate finance tests pass
6. Report completion

---

**Check Dashboard**: /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/INTEGRATION_DASHBOARD.md
**View Log**: /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/integration_orchestrator.log
```

**Step 2: YOU switch to Terminal 5 (Worker 4)**:

YOU prompt Worker 4 Claude:
```
"Worker 4, check your notification file at /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-4/NOTIFICATION.md.
There's a merge conflict in advanced_finance.rs between PWSA risk calculation and your GNN
portfolio optimization. Resolve this conflict using your finance domain expertise. Make sure
to preserve the GNN 10-100× speedup and ensure both implementations can coexist if needed."
```

**Step 3: Worker 4 Claude responds**:

Worker 4 reads the notification, analyzes the conflict, and resolves:
```
I'll check the notification and resolve the conflict.

[reads notification file]

I see the issue - there's a conflict between Worker 3's PWSA real-time risk calculation
and my GNN portfolio optimization in advanced_finance.rs lines 145-167.

Let me examine both implementations:

[analyzes code]

Both implementations are valuable and serve different purposes:
- PWSA: Real-time risk monitoring (Worker 3's domain)
- GNN: Long-term portfolio optimization (my domain)

They should BOTH be preserved. I'll integrate them using a strategy pattern with
separate execution paths.

[resolves conflict]

Conflict resolved! Changes made:
1. Created RiskStrategy trait for both implementations
2. PWSA real-time path preserved
3. GNN optimization path preserved
4. Added portfolio_mode selector
5. Tests updated for both modes

Validating GNN speedup...
✅ GNN solver: 10-100× speedup preserved
✅ All finance tests passing (23/23)
✅ No performance regression

Conflict resolution complete. Ready for Worker 0-Alpha to continue integration.
```

**Step 4: YOU switch back to Terminal 1 (Worker 0-Alpha)**:

YOU prompt Worker 0-Alpha:
```
"Worker 4 has resolved the finance conflict. The solution uses a strategy pattern
to preserve both PWSA real-time risk and GNN portfolio optimization. All tests
passing, GNN speedup preserved. Continue the integration."
```

**Step 5: Worker 0-Alpha continues**:

Worker 0-Alpha responds:
```
Excellent. Continuing integration from Phase 3, Task 3.3...

[continues orchestrator]

[INFO] Worker 4 conflict resolved - continuing
[INFO] Completing Worker 4 merge...
[SUCCESS] Merge completed
[INFO] Verifying build after Worker 4 merge...
[INFO] Build results: 0 errors, 412 warnings
[SUCCESS] Build verification PASSED
[INFO] Running finance integration tests...
[SUCCESS] test result: ok. 23 passed; 0 failed
[SUCCESS] Task 3.3: Worker 4 merge successful ✅

[continues to next task...]

## Coordination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Conflict Resolution

**Trigger**: Merge conflict in single worker's domain

**Flow**:
1. Orchestrator pauses, creates notification
2. YOU read notification
3. YOU prompt relevant worker
4. Worker resolves using domain expertise
5. YOU tell orchestrator to continue
6. Orchestrator completes merge and continues

**Time**: ~15-30 minutes per conflict

---

### Pattern 2: Cross-Worker Consultation

**Trigger**: Conflict spans multiple worker domains

**Example**: PWSA (Worker 3) + Mission Charlie (Worker 5) integration

**Flow**:
1. Orchestrator pauses, creates notification
2. YOU read notification, identify it spans Worker 3 + Worker 5
3. YOU prompt Worker 3: "Analyze this from PWSA perspective"
4. Worker 3 provides PWSA requirements
5. YOU prompt Worker 5: "Analyze this from Mission Charlie perspective, considering these PWSA requirements: [paste Worker 3 analysis]"
6. Worker 5 provides integrated solution
7. YOU optionally prompt Worker 3: "Review Worker 5's solution"
8. Worker 3 approves or suggests refinements
9. YOU tell orchestrator to continue
10. Orchestrator completes merge

**Time**: ~30-60 minutes per cross-domain conflict

---

### Pattern 3: Performance Regression Investigation

**Trigger**: Performance validation fails

**Example**: LSTM speedup drops below 50×

**Flow**:
1. Orchestrator detects performance regression
2. YOU prompt Worker 1: "LSTM speedup dropped to 35× (target: 50-100×). Investigate root cause."
3. Worker 1 analyzes recent merges
4. Worker 1 identifies issue (e.g., Worker 2's GPU kernel change)
5. YOU prompt Worker 2: "Worker 1 found that your GPU kernel change in commit ABC123 reduced LSTM speedup. Can you optimize while preserving your GPU improvements?"
6. Worker 2 optimizes
7. YOU prompt Worker 1: "Re-validate LSTM speedup"
8. Worker 1 confirms: "✅ LSTM speedup restored to 65×"
9. YOU tell orchestrator to continue

**Time**: ~45-90 minutes per performance issue

---

### Pattern 4: Build Error in Specialized Domain

**Trigger**: Build fails with errors in worker's module

**Example**: CUDA compilation error in GPU kernels

**Flow**:
1. Orchestrator detects build failure
2. YOU read build log, identify GPU/CUDA errors
3. YOU prompt Worker 2: "Build failed with CUDA errors: [paste errors]. Debug and fix."
4. Worker 2 analyzes, fixes CUDA issue
5. Worker 2: "Fixed. Error was due to CUDA 12.8 compatibility. Rebuilt successfully."
6. YOU tell orchestrator to continue

**Time**: ~20-45 minutes per build error

---

## Prompts You'll Use Repeatedly

### Generic Worker Prompt Template

```
"Worker [X], check your notification file at /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-[X]/NOTIFICATION.md
and resolve the issue described. Use your [domain] expertise to ensure [critical requirement]
is preserved."
```

### Specific Examples

**Worker 1 (Time Series/LSTM)**:
```
"Worker 1, check your notification file. There's an issue with LSTM GPU integration.
Resolve using your time-series expertise. Ensure 50-100× speedup is preserved."
```

**Worker 2 (GPU Infrastructure)**:
```
"Worker 2, check your notification file. There's a CUDA compilation error in the GPU
kernels. Debug and fix using your GPU expertise. Ensure 80%+ GPU utilization maintained."
```

**Worker 3 (PWSA/Applications)**:
```
"Worker 3, check your notification file. There's a conflict in PWSA architecture.
Resolve using your cybersecurity domain expertise. Ensure <5ms latency is preserved."
```

**Worker 4 (Finance/GNN)**:
```
"Worker 4, check your notification file. There's an issue with GNN solver integration.
Resolve using your finance expertise. Ensure 10-100× GNN speedup is preserved."
```

**Worker 5 (Mission Charlie)**:
```
"Worker 5, check your notification file. There's an issue with Mission Charlie LLM
integration. Resolve using your thermodynamic engine expertise. Ensure API keys are
properly configured."
```

**Worker 6 (LLM Advanced)**:
```
"Worker 6, check your notification file. There's an issue with multi-provider LLM
routing. Resolve using your LLM infrastructure expertise. Ensure cache efficiency
is maintained."
```

**Worker 7 (Drug Discovery/QA)**:
```
"Worker 7, check your notification file. There's an issue with drug discovery API
integration. Resolve using your domain expertise. Also perform QA validation of
the integrated system."
```

**Worker 8 (API/Deployment)**:
```
"Worker 8, check your notification file. There's an issue with API server integration.
Resolve using your deployment expertise. Ensure all endpoints are properly exposed."
```

### Orchestrator Continuation Prompt

```
"[Worker X] has resolved the [issue type]. [Summary of resolution]. Continue the integration."
```

### Cross-Worker Relay Prompt

```
"Worker [Y], Worker [X] analyzed the issue and found: [paste Worker X's analysis].
Resolve this from your [domain] perspective, considering Worker [X]'s requirements."
```

## Time Estimates

### Per-Phase Coordination Time (Your Manual Effort)

| Phase | Total Duration | Auto Time | Manual Coord | Your Effort |
|-------|----------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | 8h | 7h | 1h | Monitor + 2-3 prompts |
| **Phase 2** | 15h | 12h | 3h | 6-8 prompts, 2-3 conflicts |
| **Phase 3** | 20h | 14h | 6h | 12-15 prompts, 4-6 conflicts |
| **Phase 4** | 15h | 10h | 5h | API keys + 8-10 prompts |
| **Phase 5** | 20h | 14h | 6h | 10-12 prompts, 3-5 conflicts |
| **Phase 6** | 30h | 18h | 12h | QA validation + prod approval |
| **TOTAL** | **108h** | **75h** | **33h** | **~80-100 prompts over 18 days** |

**Your manual coordination**: ~33 hours over 18 days = **~2 hours per day**

**Breakdown**:
- 30% of time: Actively coordinating (reading notifications, prompting workers)
- 70% of time: Orchestrator running automatically (you can do other work)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Worker doesn't have context about their notification

**Cause**: Claude instance lost context or you didn't provide enough info

**Solution**: Provide full context in your prompt:
```
"Worker 4, the integration orchestrator detected a merge conflict in
src/applications/finance/advanced_finance.rs. The conflict is between
PWSA real-time risk (Worker 3) and your GNN portfolio optimization.
Check /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-4/NOTIFICATION.md for details
and resolve using your finance domain expertise."
```

---

### Issue: Orchestrator and Worker disagree on state

**Cause**: Worker made changes but orchestrator not aware

**Solution**: Always tell orchestrator what changed:
```
"Worker 2 fixed the CUDA compilation error in kernel_executor.rs.
The build now passes with 0 errors. Continue integration."
```

---

### Issue: Multiple workers need coordination

**Cause**: Issue spans multiple domains

**Solution**: Coordinate sequentially:
1. Get Worker X's analysis
2. Relay to Worker Y with Worker X's context
3. Get Worker Y's solution
4. Optionally confirm with Worker X
5. Tell orchestrator the integrated solution

---

### Issue: You're not sure which worker to prompt

**Cause**: Issue not clearly in one domain

**Solution**: Start with Worker 7 (QA Lead):
```
"Worker 7, the orchestrator encountered an issue that spans multiple
domains: [describe issue]. As QA lead, analyze this and recommend
which specialized worker(s) should handle it."
```

---
