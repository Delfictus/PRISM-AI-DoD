## EVALUATION CATEGORIES (10 categories, weighted)

### Category 1: GPU Infrastructure (Weight: 20%)

**What to Assess**:
- Real CUDA device initialization and context management
- Actual GPU memory allocation and transfer operations
- PTX/CUDA kernel loading and execution
- Error handling and resource cleanup
- Feature flags and conditional compilation

**Scoring Criteria**:

**10 points**:
- Real CUDA API calls throughout (cuInit, cuCtxCreate, cuMemAlloc, etc.)
- Comprehensive error handling with proper error types
- Resource cleanup with RAII patterns
- No CPU fallbacks in production mode
- Kernel loading from PTX with proper caching

**7 points**:
- Real CUDA API calls present
- Basic error handling
- Some resource cleanup
- Occasional CPU fallbacks
- Kernel loading works

**4 points**:
- Mix of real GPU and CPU simulation
- Weak error handling
- Resource leaks possible
- Frequent CPU fallbacks
- Kernel loading incomplete

**1 point**:
- No real CUDA code, just stubs
- No error handling
- All CPU simulation with "gpu" names

**Critical Questions**:
- [ ] Does `src/gpu/context.rs` contain actual `cuInit()` or equivalent?
- [ ] Does `src/gpu/memory.rs` use real `cuMemAlloc()` or equivalent?
- [ ] Does `src/gpu/module.rs` load real PTX kernels?
- [ ] Are there actual `cuLaunchKernel()` calls in the codebase?
- [ ] Is error handling robust (not just `.unwrap()` everywhere)?

**Weight Justification**: If GPU infrastructure is fake, entire system claim of "GPU acceleration" collapses. This is the foundation.

---

### Category 2: CUDA Kernel Reality (Weight: 15%)

**What to Assess**:
- Number of actual CUDA kernels (claimed: 61)
- Kernel implementation quality (not just stubs)
