# Known Issues

## CUBLAS Compatibility with CUDA 12.8

### Issue
Three integration tests fail due to a CUBLAS compatibility issue with CUDA 12.8:
- `test_unified_orchestrator`
- `test_health_monitoring`
- `test_bidirectional_causality`

### Error Details
```
Expected symbol in library: DlSym { desc: "/usr/local/cuda-12.8/lib64/libcublas.so: undefined symbol: cublasGetEmulationStrategy" }
```

### Root Cause
The cudarc crate attempts to load the `cublasGetEmulationStrategy` symbol which doesn't exist in CUDA 12.8's CUBLAS library. This appears to be a version compatibility issue between the cudarc crate and newer CUDA versions.

### Workaround Attempted
Created a CUBLAS compatibility layer (`src/gpu/cublas_compat.rs`) that provides:
- CPU fallback mode controlled by `PRISM_FORCE_CPU_FALLBACK` environment variable
- Modified GPU initialization to gracefully handle missing CUBLAS symbols
- CPU implementations for critical operations when GPU is unavailable

### Current Status
- 764 out of 767 tests passing (99.6% success rate)
- The 3 failing tests are isolated to CUBLAS initialization
- All core algorithms and functionality work correctly
- GPU acceleration works for all other components

### Recommended Solutions
1. **Short-term**: Use environment variable `PRISM_FORCE_CPU_FALLBACK=1` for affected tests
2. **Medium-term**: Wait for cudarc crate update to support CUDA 12.8
3. **Long-term**: Consider implementing custom CUDA bindings that avoid CUBLAS dependency

### Impact
- Minimal impact on functionality
- Only affects initial GPU context creation for specific integration tests
- All Mission Charlie algorithms function correctly
- Performance is unaffected for working GPU operations

## Test Coverage Summary
- Total Tests: 767
- Passing: 764
- Failing: 3 (CUBLAS compatibility only)
- Success Rate: 99.6%

All advanced algorithms including:
- Quantum voting consensus
- Thermodynamic free energy optimization
- GPU deterministic operations
- Transfer entropy with KSG estimator
- Active inference frameworks

Are fully functional and passing all tests.
