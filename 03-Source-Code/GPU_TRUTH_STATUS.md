# üî¥ HONEST GPU STATUS ASSESSMENT - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

## Executive Summary
**GPU acceleration is currently NOT functional in PRISM-AI**. The project is using CPU fallback for all operations.

## Critical Issues Discovered

### 1. ‚ùå Build System Broken
- cudarc dependency was missing from Cargo.toml (just added)
- Build fails even after adding due to CUDA version conflicts
- candle-kernels fails with CUDA 13
- Patch for CUDA 13 not properly applied

### 2. ‚ùå GPU Code Paths Unreachable
All modules use CPU fallbacks:
- active_inference ‚Üí CPU fallback
- quantum_mlir ‚Üí CPU fallback  
- statistical_mechanics ‚Üí Not loading GPU

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Claims vs Reality
**Claimed**: 647x speedup, 50x matrix ops, massive parallelism
**Reality**: 1x (CPU only) - GPU code never runs

### 4. üîç Evidence
The code literally prints: "[CPU Fallback] Executing operation"

## What to Do

1. Fix cudarc CUDA 13 compatibility
2. Properly integrate GPU runtime library
3. Test with nvidia-smi monitoring
4. Validate actual speedups

## Bottom Line
Your RTX 5070 is ready but PRISM-AI is NOT using it. All operations run on CPU. This is fixable but requires work.

Run `python3 verify_gpu_usage.py` while running PRISM to confirm.
