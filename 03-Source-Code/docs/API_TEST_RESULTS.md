## 7. Known Issues & Limitations

### 7.1 Current Implementation Status
⚠️ **Mock Implementations**: All endpoints currently return mock/demo data
- Real Worker module integrations pending (Phase 4+)
- Business logic placeholders marked with TODO comments

### 7.2 Validation Issue
⚠️ Finance endpoint validation may need adjustment for certain input formats
- Returns 422 during high-load scenarios
- Does not affect functional testing
- Requires review of OptimizeAdvancedRequest schema

### 7.3 Future Improvements
- Add authentication/authorization middleware
- Implement rate limiting
- Add request logging and metrics
- Connect to real Worker module implementations
- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
