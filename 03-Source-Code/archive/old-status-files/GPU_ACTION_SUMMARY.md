## üìã Implementation Roadmap

### **PHASE 1: Infrastructure** (Day 1-2)
**Goal**: Build GPU foundation

**Actions**:
1. Create GPU memory manager (`src/gpu/memory_manager.rs`)
2. Fix GPU launcher (`src/gpu_launcher.rs`)
3. Build kernel dispatch system
4. Create basic CUDA kernels (matrix multiply, softmax)

**Deliverables**:
- Working GPU memory transfers
- Kernel execution capability
- Performance benchmarking tools

---

### **PHASE 2: Quick Wins** (Day 3-5)
**Goal**: Demonstrate 20-50x speedup

**Target Modules** (in order):
1. **PWSA Active Inference Classifier**
   - File: `src/pwsa/active_inference_classifier.rs`
   - GPU ops: Linear layers, softmax
   - Expected: 25x speedup

2. **Transfer Entropy Calculator**
   - File: `src/cma/transfer_entropy_gpu.rs`
   - GPU ops: k-NN, entropy computation
   - Expected: 50x speedup

3. **GPU Launcher Completion**
   - File: `src/gpu_launcher.rs`
   - Full PTX loading and kernel dispatch

---

### **PHASE 3: Core Algorithms** (Week 2)
**Goal**: Accelerate compute-heavy modules

**Modules**:
- Neural Quantum State (50-200x speedup)
- Active Inference Policy (30-50x speedup)
- Thermodynamic Evolution (40-60x speedup)
- E3-Equivariant GNN (20-40x speedup)

---

### **PHASE 4: Optimization** (Week 3)
**Goal**: Maximize RTX 5070 performance

**Focus Areas**:
- Tensor Core utilization
- Memory coalescing
- Kernel fusion
- Multi-GPU support

---

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

### Tomorrow's Tasks:
1. **Morning**: Create GPU memory manager
2. **Afternoon**: Write first CUDA kernel
3. **Evening**: Integrate with PWSA classifier

### This Week's Goal:
- 2 modules fully GPU-accelerated
- 20x+ speedup demonstrated
- Infrastructure ready for scale

## üìä Success Metrics

| Milestone | Target Date | Success Criteria |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Infrastructure Ready | Day 2 | Memory transfers working |
| First Module GPU | Day 3 | PWSA 20x faster |
| Quick Wins Complete | Day 5 | 2 modules accelerated |
| Core Algorithms | Week 2 | 5 modules accelerated |
| Full GPU Integration | Week 3 | All compute on GPU |

## üîß Technical Approach

### Pattern for Each Module:
```rust
1. Create GPU memory pool
2. Port operations to CUDA kernels
3. Implement CPU-GPU transfers
4. Add fallback for non-GPU systems
5. Benchmark and optimize
```

### Priority Order:
1. PWSA Classifier (easiest, high impact)
2. Transfer Entropy (high compute)
3. Neural Quantum (massive parallelism)
4. Policy Evaluation (core functionality)
5. Others as needed
