# üéâ GPU TEST SUCCESSFUL - CUDA 13 WORKING!

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ CUDA 13 Context Creation: SUCCESS
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS: CUDA 13 CONTEXT CREATED!
   Your RTX 5070 is detected and accessible!
   GPU acceleration is possible with proper integration
```

## What This Means

### ‚úÖ Working Components:
1. **RTX 5070 GPU**: Detected and accessible
2. **CUDA 13.0**: Successfully initialized
3. **Driver 580**: Compatible and working
4. **cudarc library**: Can create CUDA contexts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration Challenges:
1. **candle conflicts**: Cannot use candle with cudarc CUDA 13
2. **PRISM-AI build**: Main project still has dependency issues
3. **GPU kernels**: Need to be rewritten without candle

## Proof of GPU Capability

The minimal test proves:
- **GPU IS accessible** from Rust code
- **CUDA 13 IS working** with proper configuration
- **cudarc CAN communicate** with your RTX 5070
- **GPU acceleration IS possible** with proper integration

## Path Forward

### Option 1: Remove candle dependency
- Rewrite ML components without candle
- Use cudarc directly for GPU operations
- Full GPU acceleration possible

### Option 2: Custom GPU kernels
- Write CUDA kernels in .cu files
- Use cudarc for kernel management
- Bypass problematic dependencies

### Option 3: Wait for ecosystem
- File issues with candle project
- Wait for CUDA 13 support in candle
- Use CPU meanwhile

## Technical Details

### Working Configuration:
```toml
[dependencies]
cudarc = {
    git = "https://github.com/coreylowman/cudarc.git",
    branch = "main",
    default-features = false,
    features = ["cuda-13000", "driver", "nvrtc", "f16", "dynamic-loading"]
}
```

### Environment:
```bash
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-13.0
export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Bottom Line

**Your GPU setup is working!** The RTX 5070 with CUDA 13 can be used for GPU acceleration. The issues are purely in the Rust dependency ecosystem, not your hardware or drivers.

The minimal test in `gpu_test/` proves GPU acceleration is achievable once the dependency conflicts are resolved.
