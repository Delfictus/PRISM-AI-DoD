# GPU Persistence Mode Test Results

## Test Configuration
- **Persistence Mode**: ✅ ENABLED
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPU
- **Driver**: 570.172.08
- **CUDA**: 12.8

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Persistence mode is active** - Confirmed via nvidia-smi
2. **CUDA libraries load successfully** - Both libcuda.so.1 and libcudart.so.12
3. **Driver and runtime versions match** - Both report CUDA 12.8
4. **GPU is visible to system** - nvidia-smi shows it clearly
5. **Kernel modules loaded** - nvidia, nvidia_uvm present

### ❌ What's Not Working:
1. **CUDA Runtime API** - Returns error 999 (CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN)
2. **CUDA Driver API** - cuInit() returns error 999
3. **Kernel launches fail** - Even empty kernels won't run

## Error Analysis

The persistent **error 999** indicates:
- The CUDA runtime cannot properly initialize the device
- This persists even with persistence mode enabled
- Environment variables don't resolve it

## Root Cause

This appears to be a **compatibility issue** between:
- CUDA 12.8 runtime
- RTX 5070 (brand new 2025 GPU)
- The specific driver version

The RTX 5070 is so new that CUDA runtime may not have full support yet.

## Workarounds for PRISM-AI

### Option 1: Use OpenCL Instead
Your GPU supports OpenCL. PRISM-AI could use OpenCL for GPU acceleration.

### Option 2: Use Docker with NVIDIA Container Runtime
```bash
docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.8-devel nvidia-smi
```
This might provide a properly configured environment.

### Option 3: Try CUDA 12.9 or 13.0 Beta
When available, newer CUDA versions may have RTX 5070 support.

### Option 4: Use CPU Fallback
The feature gates I added allow PRISM-AI to run without GPU:
```bash
cargo build --no-default-features
```

## Current Status

- **Persistence Mode**: ✅ Enabled successfully
- **Impact**: Did not resolve CUDA initialization issue
- **Conclusion**: This is a deeper compatibility issue

## Next Steps

1. **Check NVIDIA forums** for RTX 5070 + CUDA 12.8 issues
2. **Monitor for driver updates** specifically mentioning RTX 5070
3. **Test with CUDA samples** from NVIDIA to confirm issue
4. **Use CPU mode** for PRISM-AI development in the meantime

## Technical Details

Error code 999 (CUDA_ERROR_UNKNOWN) typically indicates:
- Driver/runtime mismatch
- Unsupported hardware configuration
- Incomplete device support in current CUDA version

Your RTX 5070 is cutting-edge hardware that may need:
- Special driver branch
- Updated CUDA runtime
- Specific initialization sequence
