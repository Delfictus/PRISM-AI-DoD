# CUDA 13 Support Status - Final Assessment

## Current Situation
✅ **CUDA 13 Installed**: Version 13.0.88
✅ **RTX 5070 Ready**: Driver 580.95.05 supports CUDA 13
✅ **cudarc Supports CUDA 13**: Latest git version has `cuda-13000` feature
❌ **Build Fails**: Dependency conflicts between candle and cudarc

## The Problem
1. **candle-core** from git specifies `dynamic-linking` feature for cudarc
2. Our patch specifies different features
3. Cargo can't reconcile the feature conflict
4. Result: "Both dynamic-loading and dynamic-linking features are active"

## Solutions Attempted
1. ✅ Updated cudarc to git version with CUDA 13 support
2. ✅ Added `cuda-13000` feature flag
3. ✅ Patched cudarc dependency
4. ❌ candle integration still conflicts

## What Actually Works
```bash
# Without candle (pure cudarc):
cudarc = { git = "...", features = ["cuda-13000", ...] }  # ✅ Works

# With candle from git:
candle brings its own cudarc config  # ❌ Conflicts
```

## Honest Assessment

### GPU Acceleration Reality:
- **Hardware**: ✅ Ready (RTX 5070 + CUDA 13)
- **Drivers**: ✅ Ready (580.95.05)
- **Build System**: ❌ **NOT WORKING**
- **GPU Usage**: ❌ **0% - All CPU fallback**

### Why This Matters:
Without successful build:
- All `#[cfg(feature = "cuda")]` code is **unreachable**
- System uses `#[cfg(not(feature = "cuda"))]` **CPU fallbacks**
- Performance is **standard CPU speed**, not GPU accelerated
- Claims of 647x speedup are **not happening**

## Path Forward

### Option 1: Remove Candle (Quick Fix)
- Remove candle dependencies
- Use cudarc directly for GPU operations
- Rewrite candle-dependent code

### Option 2: Fork and Fix Candle
- Fork candle repository
- Modify its cudarc dependency to match ours
- Use forked version

### Option 3: Wait for Upstream Fix
- File issue with candle project
- Wait for official CUDA 13 support
- Use CPU fallback meanwhile

### Option 4: Downgrade to CUDA 12
- Use CUDA 12.8 which has better support
- Lose CUDA 13 optimizations
- But gain working GPU acceleration

## Recommendation
**Be transparent**: The GPU acceleration is not functional due to dependency issues. The project runs on CPU only. This is a known issue that requires significant work to resolve.

## Verification
Run this to confirm GPU is not being used:
```bash
python3 verify_gpu_usage.py  # In terminal 1
cargo run --bin prism        # In terminal 2
# Result: 0% GPU utilization
```
