---

## 🚀 READY TO START

**Everything is in place!** You can now start the integration.

---

## STARTUP COMMAND (Terminal 1 - Worker 0-Alpha)

### Option 1: Start in Current Terminal (Recommended)

If you're already Worker 0-Alpha Claude in Terminal 1 at the correct directory:

```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh
```

### Option 2: Tell Worker 0-Alpha What To Do

If you need to prompt Worker 0-Alpha Claude, say:

```
"Start the integration orchestrator. Execute all 6 phases sequentially,
pausing when worker assistance is needed. I'll coordinate between specialized
workers as issues arise."
```

Then Worker 0-Alpha will run:
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh
```

---

## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

### Phase 1: Unblock Critical Path (Already Complete)
- ✅ Verifies Worker 2 GPU infrastructure
- ✅ Runs build verification
- ✅ Creates integration test framework
- **Status**: Should detect as already complete

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (97% Complete)
- 🔄 Merge Worker 1 time-series branch
- 🔄 Run build verification
- 🔄 Run Worker 1+2 integration tests
- 🔄 Validate performance
- **Expected**: May have conflicts (Worker 1 on-call needed)

### Phases 3-6: Continue Sequentially
- Phase 3: Merge Workers 3, 4, 5
- Phase 4: Configure API keys, merge Worker 6
- Phase 5: Merge Workers 7, 8
- Phase 6: Staging validation, production deployment

---

## MONITORING (Terminal 10)

In a separate terminal window, run:

```bash
watch -n 30 cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/INTEGRATION_DASHBOARD.md
```

This shows real-time status updates.

---

## YOUR ROLE DURING EXECUTION

### When Orchestrator Runs Smoothly
- ✅ Just monitor Terminal 1 output
- ✅ Watch dashboard updates
- ✅ No action required

### When Orchestrator Pauses
1. Read the orchestrator output (what went wrong)
2. Check notification file if created: `cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-X/NOTIFICATION.md`
3. Switch to relevant Worker X terminal (Terminal 2-9)
4. Prompt Worker X Claude to resolve (use COORDINATOR_CHEAT_SHEET.md for prompts)
5. Wait for Worker X to complete resolution
6. Switch back to Terminal 1 (Worker 0-Alpha)
7. Tell Worker 0-Alpha to continue

---

## REFERENCE DOCUMENTS

Keep these open during integration:

1. **COORDINATOR_CHEAT_SHEET.md** - Copy-paste prompts for workers
2. **HYBRID_COORDINATION_GUIDE.md** - Detailed coordination workflows
3. **Dashboard** (Terminal 10) - Real-time status

---

## EMERGENCY COMMANDS

```bash
# If you need to stop (Ctrl+C in Terminal 1)

# Rollback last merge if something goes wrong
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh --rollback

# Restart from specific phase
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh --phase 2

# Check status
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh --status
```

---

## EXPECTED TIMELINE

- **Phase 1**: 5-10 minutes (verification only, already complete)
- **Phase 2**: 2-4 hours (Worker 1 merge + testing)
- **Phase 3**: 4-6 hours (Workers 3, 4, 5 merges)
- **Phase 4**: 3-5 hours (API keys + Worker 6)
- **Phase 5**: 4-6 hours (Workers 7, 8 merges)
- **Phase 6**: 8-12 hours (Full validation + production)

**Total**: 26-43 hours of orchestrator runtime over 18 days (Oct 14-31)
**Your coordination**: ~33 hours total (~2 hours/day)

## WORKER 1 ON-CALL (Phase 2)

If Phase 2 conflicts arise, prompt Worker 1 (Terminal 2):

```
"Worker 1, check your notification file at
/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-1/NOTIFICATION.md. There's a merge
conflict in the time-series modules. Resolve using your LSTM/ARIMA
expertise. Ensure 50-100× speedup is preserved."
```

---

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

✅ **Per-phase**: Dashboard shows "✅ COMPLETE", 0 build errors
✅ **Overall**: All 6 phases complete, all worker branches merged
✅ **Performance**: All targets met (GPU 80%+, PWSA <5ms, LSTM 50-100×, etc.)
✅ **Production**: System ready for deployment

---

## FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE STARTING

- [ ] Terminal 1 open at `/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD` (Worker 0-Alpha)
- [ ] Terminal 2-9 open at `/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-X` (Workers 1-8)
- [ ] Terminal 10 open with dashboard watch command
- [ ] COORDINATOR_CHEAT_SHEET.md open in browser/editor
- [ ] Ready to spend ~2 hours coordinating today
- [ ] Other workers (1-8) available for on-call prompts

**All systems ready?** ✅

---

## 🚀 START COMMAND

```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh
```

**OR** prompt Worker 0-Alpha Claude:

```
"Start the integration orchestrator."
```

---

**Good luck! You've got this!** 🚀

The orchestrator will guide you through each phase, and you have all the
documentation you need in COORDINATOR_CHEAT_SHEET.md for handling any issues.

**Estimated completion**: October 31, 2025 (18 days from now)
**Your daily effort**: ~2 hours coordination
**Result**: Fully integrated PRISM-AI system ready for production deployment
