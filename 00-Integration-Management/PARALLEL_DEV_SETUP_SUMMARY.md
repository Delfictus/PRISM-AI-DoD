## üîÑ WORKFLOW

### **Daily Cycle**:

**Morning** (9:00 AM):
```bash
# Both workers
git checkout parallel-development
git pull
git checkout worker-[a/b]-[algorithms/infrastructure]
git merge parallel-development
```

**Evening** (5:00 PM):
```bash
# Both workers
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: [task]"
git push origin worker-[a/b]-[algorithms/infrastructure]
# Create PR to parallel-development
```

**Integration** (6:00 PM):
- Review both PRs
- Merge both to `parallel-development`
- Resolve any conflicts
- Run integration tests

### **Weekly Cycle**:

**Friday**:
- Merge `parallel-development` ‚Üí `master`
- Tag release
- Team review meeting

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  CONFLICT PREVENTION

### **Golden Rules**:

1. **Stay in your directories**
   - Worker A: routing, thermodynamic, active_inference
   - Worker B: local_llm, gpu, production

2. **Don't edit same files**
   - Check file ownership map
   - Announce if editing shared file

3. **Kernel coordination**
   - Worker B implements kernels
   - Worker A requests via GitHub issues
   - Worker A uses kernels (doesn't modify)

4. **Daily merges**
   - Catch conflicts early
   - Small conflicts are easy to resolve
