# PRISM-AI Worker Activation & Coordination Guide

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Version**: 1.0
**Integration Phase**: Phase 2 (97% Complete) → Phase 3

## Quick Answer to Your Question

**Question**: "Do I need to activate all 8 workers telling them to review their workload instructions located in GitHub issues after I start the Worker 0-Alpha integration orchestrator?"

**Answer**: **NO - The process is more automated than that.**

You do NOT need to manually tell workers to review GitHub issues. Instead:

1. **Worker 0-Alpha** starts the orchestrator
2. **Orchestrator automatically notifies workers** via file-based alerts when their help is needed
3. **Workers monitor their notification files** or respond to on-call requests
4. **Most work is automated** - workers only intervene for conflicts or specialized tasks

## Complete Startup Sequence

### Prerequisites (One-Time Setup)

Before starting integration, ensure all worker directories have notification monitoring:

```bash
# Run this ONCE to set up all workers
for worker_id in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8; do
    touch /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-$worker_id/NOTIFICATION.md
    echo "# No notifications" > /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-$worker_id/NOTIFICATION.md
done
```

---

### Phase 1: Start Orchestrator (Worker 0-Alpha)

**Worker 0-Alpha** executes:

```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh
```

**What happens**:
- Orchestrator starts executing Phase 1 (or continues from current phase)
- Dashboard updates at: `/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/INTEGRATION_DASHBOARD.md`
- Detailed log at: `/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/integration_orchestrator.log`

---

### Phase 2: Workers Set Up Monitoring (All Workers)

**Each worker** (Workers 1-8) runs in their terminal:

#### Option A: Active Monitoring (Recommended for on-call workers)
```bash
# Monitor notification file continuously (updates every 60 seconds)
watch -n 60 cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-$WORKER_ID/NOTIFICATION.md
```

Replace `$WORKER_ID` with actual worker number:
- Worker 1: `watch -n 60 cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-1/NOTIFICATION.md`
- Worker 2: `watch -n 60 cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-2/NOTIFICATION.md`
- etc.

#### Option B: Periodic Check (For background workers)
```bash
# Check notifications manually
cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-$WORKER_ID/NOTIFICATION.md
```

#### Option C: Automated Alert (Advanced)
```bash
# Set up file watcher with inotify
while inotifywait -e modify /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-$WORKER_ID/NOTIFICATION.md; do
    clear
    echo "🔔 NEW NOTIFICATION 🔔"
    cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-$WORKER_ID/NOTIFICATION.md
done
```

## Where Are Workload Instructions Located?

You asked: "review their workload instructions located at some location in a github issue"

**Answer**: Workload instructions are NOT in GitHub issues. They are in:

```
/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD/00-Integration-Management/MASTER_INTEGRATION_WORKLOAD_PLAN.md
```

### Complete Reference Locations

| Document | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Master Workload Plan** | `00-Integration-Management/MASTER_INTEGRATION_WORKLOAD_PLAN.md` | Detailed 152-hour task breakdown |
| **Orchestrator Script** | `00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh` | Automated execution engine |
| **Integration Dashboard** | `/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/INTEGRATION_DASHBOARD.md` | Real-time status |
| **Integration Log** | `/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/integration_orchestrator.log` | Detailed execution log |
| **Worker Notifications** | `/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-X/NOTIFICATION.md` | Per-worker alerts |
| **Automation Guide** | `00-Integration-Management/AUTOMATION_INFRASTRUCTURE_COMPLETE.md` | Full automation docs |

### Optional: Create GitHub Issues for Tracking

If you prefer GitHub issues for tracking, you can create them like this:

```bash
# Create GitHub issues for each phase (optional)
gh issue create --title "Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Integration" \
    --body "See MASTER_INTEGRATION_WORKLOAD_PLAN.md Section 5.2" \
    --label "integration" --label "phase-2"

gh issue create --title "Phase 3: Application Layer Integration" \
    --body "See MASTER_INTEGRATION_WORKLOAD_PLAN.md Section 5.3" \
    --label "integration" --label "phase-3"

# etc. for Phases 4-6
```

But this is **NOT REQUIRED** - the orchestrator handles coordination automatically.

---

## Current Status: Phase 2 → Phase 3 Transition

**As of October 14, 2025**:
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Complete (100%)
- 🟡 **Phase 2**: 97% complete (Worker 1 merge pending)
- ⏳ **Phase 3**: Pending (starts after Phase 2 completes)
- ⏳ **Phase 4-6**: Pending

**Current State**: Phase 2, Worker 1 merge is the next task

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Do workers need to manually check GitHub issues?
**A**: No. Workers monitor their notification files at `/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-X/NOTIFICATION.md`

### Q2: What if a worker misses a notification?
**A**: Orchestrator will pause and wait. Worker 0-Alpha can manually notify via Slack/email/phone.

### Q3: Can I run phases out of order?
**A**: No. Phases have strict dependencies. Phase 2 requires Phase 1 complete, etc.

### Q4: What happens if a phase fails?
**A**: Orchestrator stops, logs the error, notifies relevant worker, and waits for manual fix + restart.

### Q5: Can I skip worker notifications and just run orchestrator?
**A**: Yes for phases without conflicts. But have workers on-call in case issues arise.

### Q6: Where do workers find detailed task instructions?
**A**: In `00-Integration-Management/MASTER_INTEGRATION_WORKLOAD_PLAN.md` - linked in notifications.

## Emergency Contact Protocol

If orchestrator fails and notifications aren't working:

1. **Check dashboard**: `/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/INTEGRATION_DASHBOARD.md`
2. **Check log**: `/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/integration_orchestrator.log`
3. **Manual worker notification**: Call/Slack/email workers directly
4. **Rollback if needed**: `./integration_orchestrator.sh --rollback`
5. **Restart from last phase**: `./integration_orchestrator.sh --phase X`

---

## Summary: What You Actually Need To Do

**RIGHT NOW (as Worker 0-Alpha)**:

```bash
# 1. Start orchestrator (this kicks off everything)
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh
```

**WORKERS DO (once you start orchestrator)**:

Workers 1-7 each run in their terminal:
```bash
watch -n 60 cat /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-$WORKER_ID/NOTIFICATION.md
```

**THAT'S IT.**

The orchestrator handles:
- ✅ Merging branches
- ✅ Running builds
- ✅ Running tests
- ✅ Notifying workers when help needed
- ✅ Updating dashboard
- ✅ Logging everything

You do NOT need to:
- ❌ Create GitHub issues
- ❌ Manually tell workers to check issues
- ❌ Coordinate merges manually
- ❌ Run builds manually
- ❌ Run tests manually

**95% of the process is automated. Workers are on-call for the 5% that needs human intervention (conflicts, validation, approvals).**

---

**Ready to start? Run the orchestrator and let automation handle the rest.**

```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
./00-Integration-Management/integration_orchestrator.sh
```

🚀 **Good luck with the integration!**
