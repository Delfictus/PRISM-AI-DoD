## 💡 Key Insights for Production

### **Tensor Core Usage Guidelines**:

```rust
// Recommended strategy from benchmark analysis
fn select_matmul_kernel(m: usize, k: usize, n: usize) -> MatmulStrategy {
    let total_ops = m * k * n;

    if total_ops < 256 * 256 * 256 {
        MatmulStrategy::FP32  // Avoid overhead for small matrices
    } else if total_ops < 1024 * 1024 * 1024 {
        MatmulStrategy::TensorCoreFP16  // Medium matrices
    } else {
        MatmulStrategy::TensorCoreWMMA  // Maximum speedup for large
    }
}
```

### **When Tensor Cores Shine**:
- ✅ Transformer multi-head attention (4096x4096+)
- ✅ CNN convolutions as GEMM (large batches)
- ✅ LLM inference (KQV projections, FFN layers)
- ✅ GNN operations (large adjacency matrices)
- ✅ Reservoir computing (high-dimensional states)

### **Performance Expectations**:
- Small matrices (<512): FP32 faster (overhead dominates)
- Medium matrices (512-1024): FP16 competitive
- Large matrices (1024+): WMMA provides 6-10x speedup
