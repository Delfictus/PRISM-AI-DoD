## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Review Deliverables
- [ ] Review `WORKER_8_DELIVERABLES.md` for complete overview
- [ ] Review `docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for technical details
- [ ] Review `docs/API.md` for API reference
- [ ] Review `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design

### Step 2: Merge Worker 8 Branch

```bash
# Switch to integration branch (or main)
git checkout main  # or integration branch

# Merge worker-8-finance-deploy
git merge --no-ff worker-8-finance-deploy

# Resolve any conflicts (should be minimal due to zero overlap)
# All Worker 8 files are in isolated directories

# Verify merge
git log --oneline -10
```

### Step 3: Add API Server Module to lib.rs

**File**: `03-Source-Code/src/lib.rs`

Add after other module declarations:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "api_server")]
pub mod api_server;
```

### Step 4: Update Cargo.toml

**File**: `03-Source-Code/Cargo.toml`

#### Add Feature Flag:

```toml
[features]
default = ["cuda"]
cuda = ["cudarc"]
api_server = ["axum", "tower", "tower-http", "tokio-tungstenite"]
```

#### Add Dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
# Web framework (for api_server feature)
axum = { version = "0.7", features = ["ws", "macros"], optional = true }
tower = { version = "0.4", optional = true }
tower-http = { version = "0.5", features = ["cors", "trace", "fs"], optional = true }
tokio-tungstenite = { version = "0.21", optional = true }

# Existing dependencies (likely already present)
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = ["env-filter"] }
```

#### Add Binary Target:

```toml
[[bin]]
name = "api_server"
path = "src/bin/api_server.rs"
required-features = ["api_server"]
```

### Step 5: Verify Build

```bash
cd 03-Source-Code

# Check library with API server feature
cargo check --features api_server

# Check API server binary
cargo check --bin api_server

# Build with all features
cargo build --all-features

# Run tests with API server
cargo test --features api_server
```

### Step 6: Test API Server

```bash
# Set environment variables
export API_PORT=8080
export API_HOST=0.0.0.0
export API_KEY=test-integration-key

# Run API server
cargo run --bin api_server --features api_server

# In another terminal, test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","version":"0.1.0","uptime_seconds":...}
```

### Step 7: Run Integration Tests

```bash
cd tests

# Run integration test suite
bash run_integration_tests.sh

# Or run with cargo
cargo test --test integration --features api_server
```

### Step 8: Verify Documentation

- [ ] API documentation accessible at `docs/API.md`
- [ ] Architecture guide at `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [ ] Integration guide at `docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Deployment guide at `deployment/README.md`
- [ ] Tutorial notebooks in `notebooks/`

### Step 9: Test Deployment

#### Docker Test:

```bash
cd deployment
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for containers to start
sleep 10

# Test API
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check logs
docker-compose logs api

# Clean up
docker-compose down
```

#### Kubernetes Test (if applicable):

```bash
cd deployment/k8s

# Apply manifests
kubectl apply -k .

# Wait for pods
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=prism-ai -n prism-ai --timeout=120s

# Test API
kubectl port-forward -n prism-ai svc/prism-ai 8080:80
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Clean up
kubectl delete -k .
```

### Step 10: Verify Client Libraries

#### Python Client:

```bash
cd examples/python
pip install -e .
python -c "from prism_client import PrismClient; print('Python client OK')"
```

#### JavaScript Client:

```bash
cd examples/javascript
npm install
node -e "const {PrismClient} = require('./src/index.js'); console.log('JS client OK');"
```

#### Go Client:

```bash
cd examples/go
go mod tidy
go build
```

### Step 11: Test CLI Tool

```bash
cd examples/cli
cargo build --release

# Test health command
./target/release/prism --help
```

### Step 12: Test Web Dashboard

```bash
cd examples/dashboard
npm install
npm run build

# Verify build succeeded
ls -la dist/
```

## Dependencies on Other Workers

Worker 8's API server currently uses **placeholder implementations** for business logic. Integration with actual implementations from other workers:

### Required from Worker 5/6 (Core Implementation):
- `prism_ai::pwsa` module (threat detection, sensor fusion, etc.)
- `prism_ai::finance` module (portfolio optimization, risk assessment, etc.)
- `prism_ai::telecom` module (network optimization, etc.)
- `prism_ai::robotics` module (motion planning, etc.)

### Required from Worker 7 (Advanced Features):
- `prism_ai::llm` module (LLM orchestration, consensus, etc.)
- `prism_ai::timeseries` module (forecasting, anomaly detection, etc.)
- `prism_ai::pixels` module (pixel processing, TDA, etc.)

**Note**: API server will automatically use real implementations once these modules are available. No code changes required in Worker 8's code.

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

### Current Status:
- ✅ All API endpoints implemented and tested with mock data
- ✅ All authentication and authorization working
- ✅ All middleware (CORS, rate limiting, logging) functional
- ✅ WebSocket support complete
- ⏸️ Business logic uses placeholders pending other workers

### No Blockers:
- API server is fully functional as a REST interface
- Ready to integrate real business logic from other workers
- All infrastructure (Docker, K8s, CI/CD) production-ready

---

## Rollback Plan

If integration issues arise:

```bash
# Revert the merge
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>

# Or reset to before merge
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Push revert
git push origin main --force  # Use with caution
```

Alternatively, keep Worker 8's code on feature branch until all dependencies ready.
