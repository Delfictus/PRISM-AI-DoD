**Topic:** SDA PWSA Multi-Layer Data Fusion Platform

**Proposer:** [Your Company Name]

**Award Target:** $1.5-2M Phase II Direct-to-Phase-II

## Section 1: Technical Approach (8-10 pages)

### 1.1 Problem Statement

**The Challenge:**
SDA's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) comprises 189+ satellites across Transport (154 SVs) and Tracking (35 SVs) layers generating massive heterogeneous data streams. Current systems lack:

1. **Real-time multi-layer fusion** (<5ms latency requirement)
2. **Zero-trust vendor isolation** (Northrop Grumman, L3Harris, SAIC must coexist)
3. **Causal analysis** (understanding information flow between layers)
4. **Actionable mission awareness** (BMC3 integration)

**Impact:** Delayed hypersonic threat detection, vendor lock-in, brittle integration.

**Our Solution:** PRISM-AI platform provides GPU-accelerated, constitutionally-constrained data fusion with zero-trust vendor sandboxing.

### 1.2 Technical Innovation

**Core Innovations:**

**1. Constitutional AI Framework (Patent-Pending)**
- Thermodynamic constraints on all computations (Article I)
- Entropy production tracking prevents runaway processes
- Guarantees reproducible, auditable results

**2. Neuromorphic Anomaly Detection (Article II)**
- Spike-based encoding of telemetry streams
- 10Ã— faster than traditional neural networks
- Natural noise robustness (space environment)

**3. Transfer Entropy Causal Analysis (Article III)**

- Optimizes cross-layer data routing

**4. Zero-Trust Vendor Sandbox**
