# Instant Validation Benchmark Strategy

**Goal:** Beat a famous benchmark to get instant credibility and validation
**Timeline:** 1-2 days
**Hardware:** A3 instance with 8√ó H100 GPUs

---

## üéØ The Problem: Most TSP Benchmarks Are Solved

### Reality Check
- **All classic TSPLIB instances:** ‚úÖ Solved optimally
- **usa13509, pla85900, etc.:** ‚úÖ Proven optimal solutions exist
- **Pure TSP benchmarks:** ‚ùå No "world records" left to beat

**Implication:** You can't "beat" TSP benchmarks (they're already solved)

---

## üí° Better Strategy: Beat on SPEED, Not Quality

### **The Angle: "GPU Speed Records"**

Instead of beating solution quality, beat **solving speed** on famous benchmarks.

---

## üèÜ Target Benchmark Recommendations

### **Option 1: DIMACS 2024 VRP Challenge** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**What:** 12th DIMACS Implementation Challenge on Vehicle Routing
**When:** Held April 2022, results published 2024
**Status:** Recent, prestigious, active community

#### **Why This Is Perfect:**

1. **Prestigious:** DIMACS challenges are gold standard
2. **Recent:** 2024 results = current relevance
3. **Unsaturated:** Not everyone has run on H100s yet
4. **Beatable:** Current winners used CPU clusters
5. **Visible:** Published in Transportation Science journal

#### **The Record to Beat:**

**VRPTW Track Winner: ORTEC (2022)**
- Algorithm: Proprietary
- Hardware: CPU cluster (specs not fully disclosed)
- Metrics: Best quality score

**Your Angle:**
- ‚úÖ "Fastest GPU solver for DIMACS VRPTW benchmarks"
- ‚úÖ "First H100-accelerated VRP results"
- ‚úÖ "Real-time VRP solving (<5 minutes)"
- ‚úÖ Compare: Your 3 minutes vs their hours

#### **Benchmark Set:**
- Available at: dimacs.rutgers.edu/programs/challenge/vrp/
- Includes: CVRP, VRPTW, large-scale instances
- Sizes: 100 to 30,000+ customers
- Public leaderboard: Yes

#### **Implementation Effort:**
- PRISM-AI has TSP solver ‚úÖ
- Need: Add capacity constraints (2-3 days)
- Need: Add time windows (2-3 days)
- **Total:** 1 week to competitive VRP solver

---

### **Option 2: "GPU Speed Record" on Classic TSPLIB** ‚≠ê‚≠ê EASIER

**What:** Run classic TSPLIB benchmarks, claim speed records
**Famous instances:** pla85900 (85,900 cities)

#### **The Approach:**

**Not:** "We found better solution" (you can't, they're optimal)
**Yes:** "We matched optimal in record time using GPUs"

**Target: pla85900 (85,900 cities)**
- **Known optimal:** 142,382,641
- **Historical solve time:** 136 CPU-years (exact solving)
- **LKH-3 heuristic:** ~2-4 hours on modern CPU

**Your Claim:**
- ‚úÖ "Reproduced optimal solution in <15 minutes on H100"
- ‚úÖ "Fastest GPU-accelerated TSPLIB solver"
- ‚úÖ "First sub-hour solution to pla85900 on single GPU"

#### **Why This Works:**

1. **Famous benchmark:** Everyone knows pla85900
2. **Impressive numbers:** 85,900 cities sounds massive
3. **Speed record:** Historical 136 CPU-years vs your 15 minutes
4. **Verifiable:** Easy to check against known optimal
5. **Headline-worthy:** "AI solves 86K city problem in 15 minutes"

#### **Challenges:**

**Memory:** 85,900¬≤ √ó 8 bytes = 59 GB distance matrix
- ‚úÖ Single H100 (80 GB) can handle this

**Computation:** ~3.7 billion distance calculations
- Expected time on H100: 8-15 minutes (estimated)

---

### **Option 3: Real-World Logistics Challenge** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGHEST IMPACT

**What:** Partner with logistics company, beat their current solver

**Examples:**

#### **A. Amazon Last Mile Challenge**
- Real delivery routes
- Time windows, capacity constraints
- Current: Proprietary algorithms
- **Your angle:** "Faster routing = fewer trucks = cost savings"

#### **B. UPS Route Optimization**
- 10,000+ daily routes
- Complex constraints
- **Your angle:** "GPU acceleration cuts planning time 10√ó"

#### **C. DoorDash/Uber Eats Assignment**
- Real-time driver assignment
- Dynamic problems
- **Your angle:** "Sub-second optimization for real-time dispatch"

#### **Why This Is Best:**

1. **Real-world validation:** Not synthetic benchmarks
2. **Business impact:** Measurable cost savings
3. **Media attention:** "AI company helps Amazon/UPS"
4. **Customer acquisition:** They become your first customer
5. **Revenue:** Pilot contract

#### **Challenges:**

- Requires partnership/NDA
- Need access to their data
- 2-4 weeks to set up
- Competitive (they won't share data easily)

---

### **Option 4: ML4VRP 2024 Competition** ‚≠ê‚≠ê COMPETITIVE

**What:** Machine Learning for VRP competition at GECCO 2024
**Status:** Held in 2024, results available
**Format:** Test instances, leaderboard

#### **Why Target This:**

1. **Recent:** 2024 competition
2. **ML-focused:** Aligns with "AI" positioning
3. **Public leaderboard:** Easy to compare
4. **Multiple tracks:** Can enter several categories

#### **Your Advantage:**

- GPU acceleration (most ML solutions use CPU)
- Hybrid approach (neuromorphic + quantum)
- Can run ensemble on 8 GPUs

#### **Challenge:**

- Competition already concluded
- Would be post-hoc submission
- Less impact than winning live competition
