# Worker $i - Quick Start

**Your Worktree**: \`/home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-$i\`
**Your Branch**: \`worker-$i-[branch-name]\`
**Your Time**: ~254 hours (7 weeks)

## Start Working

1. Read your vault:
\`\`\`bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-$i
cat .worker-vault/QUICK_REFERENCE.md
cat .worker-vault/Constitution/WORKER_${i}_CONSTITUTION.md
cat .worker-vault/Tasks/MY_TASKS.md
\`\`\`

2. Start development:
\`\`\`bash
cd 03-Source-Code
cargo build --features cuda
cargo test
\`\`\`

3. Daily workflow:
- Morning: \`git pull && git merge parallel-development\`
- Work: Edit your assigned files
- Evening: \`git commit && git push\`

See \`.worker-vault/\` for complete documentation.
