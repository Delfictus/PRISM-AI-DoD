## FILE OWNERSHIP (Zero Overlap)

**Worker 1**: `src/orchestration/routing/te_*.rs`, `src/active_inference/hierarchical_*.rs`
**Worker 2**: `src/gpu/kernel_executor.rs`, `src/gpu/tensor_core_*.rs`, `src/gpu/async_*.rs`
**Worker 3**: `src/applications/drug_discovery/*`, `src/pwsa/ml_*.rs`, `src/pwsa/multi_frame_*.rs`
**Worker 4**: `src/applications/financial/*`, `src/applications/solver/*`
**Worker 5**: `src/orchestration/thermodynamic/*`, `src/cma/neural/gnn_*.rs`
**Worker 6**: `src/orchestration/local_llm/*`, `tests/llm_*.rs`, `benches/*`
**Worker 7**: `src/applications/robotics/*`, `src/applications/scientific/*`
**Worker 8**: `src/api_server/*`, `deployment/*`, `docs/*`, `examples/*`, `notebooks/*`

**ZERO FILE OVERLAP - Complete isolation**

## DAILY WORKFLOW

### Morning (9 AM):
Each worker in their worktree:
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-[1-8]
git pull origin worker-[1-8]-[branch-name]
git merge parallel-development
cargo build --features cuda
```

### Work (9 AM - 5 PM):
Each worker works independently in their workspace.

### Evening (5 PM):
Each worker commits and pushes:
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-[1-8]
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: [what you did]"
git push origin worker-[1-8]-[branch-name]
```

### Integration (6 PM):
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
# Merge all in dependency order (2→6→1→5→3→7→4→8)
```

## COORDINATION

**Pairs**:
- 1+5: AI algorithms
- 2+6: Infrastructure
- 3+7: Applications A
- 4+8: Applications B

**Daily standup**: Each pair reports together
**Kernel requests**: GitHub issues to Worker 2
**API specs**: GitHub issues to Worker 8

---

## ADVANTAGES

✅ **8 independent builds** (no cargo conflicts)
✅ **8 separate target/ directories**
✅ **Simultaneous editing** (different files)
✅ **Independent push** (no mixing)
✅ **Shared .git** (efficient storage)
✅ **Easy integration** (merge branches)

**This is MAXIMUM parallelization on one computer.**

Timeline: 6 weeks instead of 15 weeks (8× speedup)
