# Worktree Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Action**: Cleaned all 8 worker worktrees
**Result**: Only essential files remain, zero confusion

---

## WHAT WAS REMOVED

**22 Obsolete Documentation Files** archived:
- CUDA13 setup guides (GPU already working)
- GPU migration plans (migration complete)
- Old status files (superseded)
- CPU fallback audit (already eliminated)
- PTX loading guides (resolved)
- Old PWSA tasks (superseded)

**Kept in Main Repo**: `03-Source-Code/archive/old-status-files/`
**Removed from Workers**: All 8 worktrees cleaned

---

## CURRENT STATE - EACH WORKER

### **Worker 1** (`PRISM-Worker-1/`):
```
├── README.md (project overview)
├── PARALLEL_DEV_SETUP_SUMMARY.md (coordination)
├── WORKER_1_README.md (their 280h of tasks)
└── 03-Source-Code/ (all source code)
    ├── src/orchestration/routing/ (OWNS)
    ├── src/active_inference/ (OWNS)
    ├── src/time_series/ (OWNS - will create)
    └── [all other code for compilation]
```

**Clean**: ✅ Only 3 docs, all relevant

### **Worker 2** (`PRISM-Worker-2/`):
```
├── README.md
├── PARALLEL_DEV_SETUP_SUMMARY.md
├── WORKER_2_README.md (their 225h of tasks)
└── 03-Source-Code/
    ├── src/gpu/ (OWNS - ALL GPU code)
    ├── src/production/ (OWNS)
    ├── tests/ (OWNS)
    └── benches/ (OWNS)
```

**Clean**: ✅ Focus on GPU infrastructure

### **Workers 3-8**: Similar structure
- 3 essential docs each
- Clean workspaces
- Only their task assignments
- All source code available (needed for compilation)

---

## WHY SOURCE CODE STAYS

**Question**: "Why not remove code they don't own?"
**Answer**: **Rust compilation requires full crate**

- All workers need all src/ files to compile
- Cargo resolves dependencies across modules
- Removing files would break builds
- **Solution**: Clear ownership via documentation, not file removal

**What WAS removed**: Confusing/outdated documentation
**What STAYS**: All source code (needed for builds)

---

## WORKER FOCUS - GUARANTEED NO OVERLAP

**File Editing Ownership** (enforced by documentation):

| Worker | Owns (Can Edit) | Reads (Can't Edit) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | `routing/`, `active_inference/`, `time_series/` | `gpu/` |
| 2 | `gpu/`, `production/`, `tests/` | Everything (provides kernels) |
| 3 | `drug_discovery/`, `pwsa/` | `routing/`, `gpu/` |
| 4 | `financial/`, `solver/` | `routing/`, `gpu/` |
| 5 | `thermodynamic/`, `gnn_training/` | `gpu/` |
| 6 | `local_llm/`, test infrastructure | `gpu/` |
| 7 | `robotics/`, `scientific/` | `time_series/`, `gpu/` |
| 8 | `api_server/`, `deployment/`, `docs/` | Everything (integrates all) |

**Enforced by**:
- Clear documentation (WORKER_X_README.md)
- Code review on PRs
- Daily standup communication

---

## VERIFICATION

### Check Worker 1:
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-1
ls *.md
# Output:
# README.md
# PARALLEL_DEV_SETUP_SUMMARY.md
# WORKER_1_README.md
# ✅ Clean - only 3 docs
```

### Check All Workers:
```bash
for i in {1..8}; do
  echo "Worker $i:"
  ls /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-$i/*.md | wc -l
done

# Each should show: 3
```

---

## BENEFITS

✅ **No Confusion**:
- No outdated status files
- No superseded plans
- Only current relevant docs

✅ **Clear Focus**:
- WORKER_X_README.md shows exactly what they do
- No ambiguity about responsibilities

✅ **Clean Git History**:
- Obsolete docs archived, not deleted
- Can reference if needed
- But not cluttering worktrees

✅ **Faster Onboarding**:
- New developer reads WORKER_X_README.md
- Immediately knows what to do
- No confusion from old docs

---

## WHAT EACH WORKER SEES

**When they enter their workspace**:

```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-1
cat WORKER_1_README.md

# Shows:
# - Your 280 hours of work
# - Your files to create/edit
# - Dependencies on other workers
# - Success criteria
# - Daily commands
```

**No confusion, just clarity.**

---

## ARCHIVED FILES

**Location**: `03-Source-Code/archive/old-status-files/`

**Contents** (22 files):
- Old CUDA setup guides
- GPU migration plans
- CPU fallback audits
- PTX loading docs
- Old status reports

**Purpose**: Historical reference, not current guidance

**Accessible in main repo** if needed, but hidden from worker worktrees.

---

## SUMMARY

**Before Cleanup**:
- 30+ .md files per worktree
- Mix of old and new docs
- Potential confusion

**After Cleanup**:
- 3 .md files per worktree
- Only current relevant docs
- Clear focus

**Workers can now start with confidence, knowing exactly what they need to do.**

**All 8 worktrees cleaned and ready for development.**
