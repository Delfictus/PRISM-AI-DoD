## DEPENDENCY GRAPH

```
Week 1-2:  Worker 2 (GPU kernels) → enables → Worker 1 (algorithms)
Week 3-4:  Worker 1 (GNN training) + Worker 2 (LLM) → parallel
Week 5-8:  Worker 1 (trained models) → enables → Worker 3 & 4 (applications)
Week 9-12: All workers integrate, Worker 4 deploys
```

**Critical Path**: Worker 2 (weeks 1-2) → Worker 1 (weeks 3-6) → Worker 3/4 (weeks 7-11)

---

## DAILY COORDINATION

### **Morning Standup** (9:00 AM - 15 min):
```
Worker 1: "Working on KSG TE, needs digamma kernel from Worker 2"
Worker 2: "Adding digamma kernel today, ETA 2pm"
Worker 3: "Waiting for GNN training, working on drug API design"
Worker 4: "Building solver abstraction, independent work"
```

### **Kernel Request Protocol**:

**Worker 1, 3, or 4 needs kernel** → Create GitHub issue `[KERNEL]`
**Worker 2** implements within 24-48h, notifies in issue

### **Integration Points** (Weekly):

**Friday 5pm**: All workers merge to `parallel-development`
**Friday 6pm**: Integration testing
**Friday 7pm**: Fix any issues
**Friday 8pm**: Merge to `master` if tests pass

---

## MERGE ORDER (CRITICAL)

**Daily merge to `parallel-development`**:

1. **Worker 2 merges first** (provides infrastructure)
2. **Worker 1 merges second** (uses Worker 2's kernels)
3. **Worker 3 merges third** (uses Worker 1's AI + Worker 2's GPU)
4. **Worker 4 merges last** (uses everything)

**Rationale**: Dependencies flow 2→1→3/4, so merge in dependency order

---

## COMMUNICATION CHANNELS

### **GitHub Issues** - Async coordination:
- `[KERNEL]` - Worker 2 implements
- `[QUESTION]` - General questions
- `[BLOCKER]` - Critical blockers
