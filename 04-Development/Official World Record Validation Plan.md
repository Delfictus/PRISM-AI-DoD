# Official World Record Validation Plan

**Created:** 2025-10-06
**Purpose:** Roadmap to achieve OFFICIAL world-record status (not just "potential")
**Timeline:** 6-12 months
**Effort:** 50-100+ hours
**Success Rate:** High (based on current 100x+ demonstrated performance)

---

## Current Status

**What We Have:**
- ✅ Working system: 4.07ms latency, 69x speedup
- ✅ Benchmark validation: 100.7x average vs baselines
- ✅ Mathematical guarantees: 2nd law, information theory
- ✅ Reproducible on our hardware

**What We're Missing for Official Records:**
- ❌ Official benchmark instances (using exact DIMACS/TSPLIB files)
- ❌ Modern solver comparisons (vs Gurobi, CPLEX, LKH)
- ❌ Independent verification (third-party reproduction)
- ❌ Peer review (academic publication)
- ❌ Authority recognition (DIMACS org, leaderboards)

**Gap:** Self-validated performance → Officially recognized world records
