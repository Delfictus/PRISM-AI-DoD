## Implementation Details

### 1. Financial Portfolio Optimization

**Location**: `03-Source-Code/src/applications/financial/`

#### Components

**Portfolio Optimizer** (`mod.rs:96-389`)
- Mean-Variance Optimization using gradient descent
- Covariance matrix calculation (GPU-ready, marked for Worker 2 kernels)
- Quadratic programming solver with constraints
- Expected return, risk, and Sharpe ratio calculations
- Integration with Transfer Entropy for causal weighting
- Integration with market regime detection

**Market Regime Detector** (`market_regime.rs:42-256`)
- Uses Active Inference GenerativeModel
- Detects 6 market regimes:
  - Bull Market (1.2x exposure adjustment)
  - Bear Market (0.8x exposure adjustment)
  - High Volatility (0.7x conservative)
  - Low Volatility (1.1x slightly aggressive)
  - Normal (1.0x neutral)
  - Transition (0.9x cautious)
- Volatility and trend analysis
- Confidence scoring

#### Key Innovations

1. **Causal Asset Weighting**
   ```rust
   // Assets with higher Transfer Entropy influence get higher weights
   let causal_weights = calculate_causal_weights(assets)?;
   adjusted_returns = expected_returns * causal_weights * regime_factor;
   ```

2. **Regime-Adaptive Strategy**
   ```rust
   let regime_factor = detector.regime_adjustment_factor();
   // Bull: 1.2, Bear: 0.8, HighVol: 0.7, etc.
   ```

3. **Multi-Objective Optimization**
   - Maximize: `w^T * μ - λ * w^T * Σ * w`
   - Subject to: `sum(w) = 1`, `w_i ∈ [0, 0.4]`

#### Performance

- **Algorithm**: Gradient descent with 1000 iterations
- **Constraints**: Position limits (0-40% per asset)
- **Features**: Transfer Entropy, Regime Detection, Sharpe Ratio
- **GPU Acceleration**: Ready (pending Worker 2 kernels)

#### Testing

- ✅ Optimizer creation and configuration
- ✅ Sharpe ratio calculation
- ✅ Simple portfolio optimization (2-3 assets)
- ✅ Covariance matrix calculation and symmetry

           ProblemData::Portfolio { .. } => ProblemType::PortfolioOptimization,
           // ... auto-detects from structure
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Intelligent Routing**
   ```rust
   let solution = match &problem.data {
       ProblemData::Graph { adjacency_matrix, .. } =>
           self.solve_graph_problem(adjacency_matrix).await?,
       ProblemData::Portfolio { assets, .. } =>
           self.solve_portfolio_problem(assets, ...)?,
       // Routes to optimal PRISM-AI subsystem
   };
   ```

3. **Comprehensive Explanations**
   ```rust
   let explanation = format!(
       "Graph coloring solved using Phase 6 Adaptive Solver.\n\
        Colors used: {}\n\
        Method: Active Inference + Thermodynamic Evolution",
       result.num_colors
   );
   ```
