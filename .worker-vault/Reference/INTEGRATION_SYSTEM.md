# Integration System Overview - Worker 1

**Your Role**: AI Core & Time Series Development
**Integration Manager**: Worker 0-Beta (automated) + Worker 0-Alpha (human)

---

## üöÄ How Integration Works

### **Daily Auto-Sync** (You Use This)

When you start work or continue:
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-1
./worker_start.sh 1
```

**This automatically**:
1. ‚úÖ Pulls your latest commits
2. ‚úÖ Merges integration-staging
3. ‚úÖ **Checks if Worker 2's GPU kernels available**
4. ‚úÖ **Auto-pulls GPU kernels when available**
5. ‚úÖ Validates build
6. ‚úÖ Reports: READY or WAITING

### **When Dependencies Available**
```
‚úÖ Worker 2: Base GPU kernels AVAILABLE
üì• Auto-pulling GPU kernels...
‚úÖ Build validation PASSED

üöÄ Worker 1 Status: READY
   Can proceed with time series implementation!
```

### **When Dependencies Not Ready**
```
‚è≥ Worker 2: Base GPU kernels NOT READY
   Waiting for Worker 2...

üí° Worker 1 Status: WAITING
   I'll auto-pull when available!
```

## üì¶ Publishing Your Deliverables

### **When You Complete Time Series Module** (Week 3)

```bash
# 1. Test your work
cargo test --lib time_series

# 2. Commit to your branch
git add src/time_series/*
git commit -m "feat: Complete time series forecasting module"
git push origin worker-1-ai-core

# 3. Publish to deliverables
git fetch origin deliverables
git checkout deliverables
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# 4. Update tracking
echo "‚úÖ Worker 1: Time series forecasting (Week 3) - AVAILABLE" >> .worker-deliverables.log

# 5. Update manifest
# Edit DELIVERABLES.md: Change Worker 1 time series from ‚è≥ to ‚úÖ

# 6. Push
git add .worker-deliverables.log DELIVERABLES.md
git commit -m "Worker 1 deliverable: time series forecasting"
git push origin deliverables

# 7. Return to your branch
git checkout worker-1-ai-core
```

**This unblocks**: Workers 5 and 7 who need your time series module!

## üîí Governance Rules (STRICT)

Before every work session, governance engine checks:

### **Rule 1: File Ownership**
‚úÖ **YOU CAN EDIT**:
- `src/active_inference/`
- `src/orchestration/routing/`
- `src/time_series/`
- `src/information_theory/`

‚ùå **YOU CANNOT EDIT**:
- `src/gpu/` (Worker 2 only)
- `src/pwsa/` (Worker 3 only)
- Other workers' directories

‚ö†Ô∏è **SHARED FILES** (coordinate first):
- `src/lib.rs`
- `src/integration/mod.rs`
- `Cargo.toml`

### **Rule 2: Dependencies**
- Must have Worker 2's GPU kernels before using GPU
- Auto-sync system ensures this

### **Rule 3: GPU Mandate**
- All computational code MUST use GPU kernels
- No CPU loops for heavy computation
- Request kernels from Worker 2 if needed

### **Rule 4: Build Hygiene**
- Code must build before committing
- Run `cargo check --features cuda` before push
- Fix all errors immediately

### **Rule 5: Daily Progress**
- Commit at least once per day
- Use proper commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`
- Push to your branch at end of day

---

## üìã Your Dependencies

### **Depends On: Worker 2 (GPU Kernels)**

**Week 1**: Base GPU kernels
- Status: Check with `./worker_start.sh 1`
- Auto-pulls when available

**Week 2**: Time series kernels
- Kernels: `ar_forecast`, `lstm_cell`, `gru_cell`, `kalman_filter`, `uncertainty_propagation`
- Required for your time series implementation
- Auto-pulls when Worker 2 delivers

---

## üéØ Who Depends On You

### **Workers 5 & 7 Need Your Time Series Module**

**Worker 5** (Advanced Thermodynamic):
- Needs: Your time series forecasting (Week 3)
- For: LLM cost forecasting
- Status: **BLOCKED** until you complete

**Worker 7** (Robotics):
- Needs: Your time series forecasting (Week 3)
- For: Trajectory prediction
- Status: **BLOCKED** until you complete

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Complete time series by end of Week 3 to unblock Workers 5 & 7!

---

## üìä Integration Timeline

### **Week 1-2**: Get GPU Infrastructure
- Worker 2 delivers base GPU kernels
- You auto-pull and integrate
- Begin basic AI infrastructure

### **Week 2-3**: Get Time Series Kernels
- Worker 2 delivers time series kernels
- You auto-pull and integrate
- **Implement time series forecasting**

### **Week 3**: Deliver Time Series Module
- **YOU PUBLISH**: Time series module to deliverables
- **UNBLOCKS**: Workers 5 & 7
- Critical milestone!

### **Week 4-5**: Advanced Features
- Continue with advanced TE
- All dependencies available
- Full parallel development

## üö® If Governance Blocks You

**Scenario**: You try to edit `src/gpu/kernel_executor.rs`

```
‚ùå GOVERNANCE STATUS: BLOCKED

‚õî Worker 1 is BLOCKED from proceeding

VIOLATIONS DETECTED:
  ‚Ä¢ Editing file outside ownership: src/gpu/kernel_executor.rs
  ‚Ä¢ Worker 1 does NOT own this file

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
  1. Revert changes to src/gpu/kernel_executor.rs
  2. If you need a kernel, request from Worker 2 via GitHub issue
  3. Run governance check again
```

**Fix**:
1. Revert the file: `git checkout src/gpu/kernel_executor.rs`
2. Create kernel request: GitHub issue for Worker 2
3. Re-run: `./worker_start.sh 1`

---

## üí° Best Practices

### **Daily Workflow**
```bash
# Morning
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-1
./worker_start.sh 1  # Auto-syncs dependencies

# Work on your features
# Edit files in src/time_series/, src/active_inference/, etc.

# Test frequently
cargo test --lib time_series

# Evening
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Implement ARIMA forecasting on GPU"
git push origin worker-1-ai-core
```

### **When Completing a Feature**
1. Test thoroughly
2. Commit to your branch
3. **Publish to deliverables** (see above)
4. Update `.worker-deliverables.log`
5. Notify dependent workers (Workers 5 & 7 in your case)

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

- [ ] Use `./worker_start.sh 1` to start each session
- [ ] Only edit files you own (governance enforces)
- [ ] Use GPU kernels (no CPU loops)
- [ ] Test before committing
- [ ] Commit daily with good messages
- [ ] **Publish time series module by Week 3** (critical!)
- [ ] Update deliverables tracking when publishing
