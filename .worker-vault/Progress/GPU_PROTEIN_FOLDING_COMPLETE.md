## Implementation Details

### 1. Main Entry Point

```rust
pub fn predict_structure(
    &self,
    sequence: &str,
    temperature: Option<f32>,
) -> Result<ProteinPrediction>
```

**Pipeline**:
1. Encode amino acid sequence to feature vectors (20-dim one-hot + properties)
2. Predict contact map using CNN (16 protein-specific filters)
3. Analyze secondary structure (helices, sheets, loops, coils)
4. Compute free energy (ΔG = ΔH - TΔS)
5. Calculate Shannon entropy and information gain
6. Detect binding pockets via TDA (persistent homology)
7. Analyze phase dynamics (Kuramoto oscillators + Transfer Entropy)
8. Simulate folding trajectory (reservoir computing)

### 2. CNN Protein Architecture

**Specialized Filters** (5×5 kernels):
- Filter 0: Alpha helix detector (i, i+4 diagonal)
- Filter 1: Beta sheet detector (anti-diagonal)
- Filter 2: Short-range contacts (|i-j| < 6)
- Filter 3: Medium-range contacts (6 ≤ |i-j| < 12)
- Filter 4: Long-range contacts (|i-j| ≥ 12)
- Filter 5: Disulfide bridge detector
- Filter 6: Hydrophobic cluster detector
- Filter 7: Salt bridge detector
- Filters 8-12: Additional structural patterns
- Filters 13-15: Learnable filters (random initialization)

**Key Difference from Attention CNN**:
- 5×5 kernels (vs 3×3) to capture i,i+4 helix patterns
- 16 filters (vs 8) for protein structure diversity
- Hand-crafted filters based on known structural motifs

### 3. Free Energy Calculation

```rust
fn compute_free_energy_gpu(
    &self,
    sequence: &str,
    contact_map: &Array2<f32>,
    structure: &ProteinStructureFeatures,
    temp: f32,
) -> Result<FreeEnergyAnalysis>
```

**Energy Components**:

**Hydrophobic Effect**:
- Identifies buried hydrophobic residues
- Energy: -0.5 kcal/mol per buried hydrophobic contact
- Based on hydrophobicity scale (Ala=1.8, Leu=3.8, etc.)

**Hydrogen Bonding**:
- Backbone H-bonds (helix, sheet formation)
- Sidechain H-bonds (specific interactions)
- Energy: -1.0 to -3.0 kcal/mol per H-bond
- Counts donor/acceptor capacity per amino acid

**Electrostatics**:
- Salt bridges (charged residue pairs)
- Long-range Coulomb interactions
- Energy: -5.0 kcal/mol per salt bridge (approximate)
- Considers pH and charge state

**Van der Waals**:
- Packing interactions (contact density)
- Energy: -0.1 kcal/mol per contact
- Based on contact map density

**Configurational Entropy**:
- Loss of conformational freedom upon folding
- Entropy term: T·ΔS = k_B·T·ln(conformational_states)
- Higher structure = lower entropy = more favorable folding

**Result**:
```rust
ΔG_folding = ΔH - T·ΔS
```
- Negative ΔG → favorable folding
- Typical range: -50 to -200 kcal/mol for stable proteins

### 4. Shannon Entropy Analysis

```rust
fn compute_shannon_entropy_gpu(
    &self,
    contact_map: &Array2<f32>,
    structure: &ProteinStructureFeatures,
) -> Result<EntropyAnalysis>
```

**Entropy Components**:

**Contact Map Entropy**:
- Spatial distribution of contacts
- H_contact = -Σ p(contact) log₂ p(contact)
- Measures structural uncertainty

**Distribution Entropy**:
- Feature map activation distribution
- H_dist = -Σ p(activation) log₂ p(activation)
- Indicates structural complexity

**Structure Type Entropy**:
- Secondary structure diversity
- H_struct = -Σ p(helix, sheet, loop) log₂ p(type)
- Higher diversity = higher entropy

**Range Entropy**:
- Contact range distribution (short/medium/long)
- H_range = -Σ p(range) log₂ p(range)
- Indicates folding topology

**Information Gain**:
```rust
information_gain = max_entropy - total_entropy
```
- Measures ordering achieved by folding
- Higher gain = more structured protein

**Order Parameter**:
```rust
order = information_gain / max_entropy
```
- Range: 0 (random) to 1 (perfectly ordered)
- Typical folded proteins: 0.6-0.8

### 5. Binding Pocket Detection

```rust
fn detect_binding_pockets_tda(&self, contact_map: &Array2<f32>)
    -> Result<Vec<BindingPocket>>
```

**Method** (Topological Data Analysis):
1. Compute contact density per residue
2. Find low-density regions (potential cavities)
3. Apply persistent homology to detect topological holes
4. Compute Betti numbers (β₁ = 1D holes = pockets)
5. Estimate pocket volume and drug-binding potential

**Betti Numbers**:
- β₀: Connected components
- β₁: Holes/cavities (binding pockets!)
- β₂: Voids

**Drug Discovery Application**:
- Pockets with β₁ > 0 are candidate binding sites
- Volume estimation for drug size compatibility
- Confidence scoring based on persistence

**Note**: Full TDA integration awaits Phase 6 completion. Current implementation uses heuristic low-density detection with TDA placeholders.

### 6. Phase Dynamics Analysis

**Kuramoto Oscillators**:
```
dθᵢ/dt = ωᵢ + Σⱼ Kᵢⱼ·sin(θⱼ - θᵢ)
```
- Each residue = oscillator
- Coupling strength from contact map
- Phase coherence measures cooperative folding

**Transfer Entropy**:
```
TE(i→j) = H(Xⱼ,t+1 | Xⱼ,t) - H(Xⱼ,t+1 | Xⱼ,t, Xᵢ,t)
```
- Measures causal information flow between residues
- Identifies key folding nucleation sites
- Directional coupling (i causes j vs j causes i)

**Sync Clusters**:
- Groups of phase-locked residues
- Indicates cooperative folding domains
- Correlates with secondary structure elements

### 7. Reservoir Folding Simulation

**Echo State Property**:
- Reservoir has inherent computational capability
- No training required for temporal dynamics
- Universal approximation of dynamical systems

**Folding Trajectory**:
1. Initialize reservoir state with sequence encoding
2. Evolve reservoir dynamics (recurrent processing)
3. Extract folding states at timesteps
4. Measure structural convergence
5. Compute final stability metrics

**Why Zero-Shot Works**:
- Physics of folding = dynamical system
- Reservoir naturally captures dynamical attractors
- Echo State = universal computation
- Folded state = attractor in conformational space

2. **Topology is Coordinate-Free**
   - Persistent homology finds holes without 3D coordinates
   - Betti numbers are topological invariants
   - Binding pockets = topological features
   - Works from contact map alone

3. **Information Theory is Fundamental**
   - Shannon entropy measures uncertainty
   - Protein folding = entropy reduction
   - Information gain quantifies structure
   - Universal metric for all systems

4. **Reservoir Computing is Echo State**
   - Echo State Property: inherent computation
   - No training required for dynamics
   - Universal approximation of dynamical systems
   - Folding = attractor dynamics

5. **Phase Dynamics is Universal**
   - Kuramoto model applies to any coupled oscillators
   - Residues = oscillators coupled by contacts
   - Synchronization = cooperative folding
   - Transfer Entropy = causal information flow
