- [x] **Task 1.3.4 COMPLETE**: Implemented full KSG formula: TE = ψ(k) + ⟨ψ(n_x)⟩ - ⟨ψ(n_xy)⟩ - ⟨ψ(n_y)⟩
- [x] Implemented joint space embedding: [Y_future, Y_past, X_past]
- [x] Implemented 3 marginal spaces: X (source), Y (target), XY (joint history)
- [x] Added automatic parameter selection with `compute_transfer_entropy_auto()`
- [x] Added bidirectional TE computation: TE(X→Y) and TE(Y→X)
- [x] Added net information flow computation

- [x] Added validation report formatter with pass/fail metrics
- [x] Built-in accuracy verification against expected TE ranges
- [x] All tests verify correct behavior: high TE for coupling, low for independence
- [x] Library builds without errors
