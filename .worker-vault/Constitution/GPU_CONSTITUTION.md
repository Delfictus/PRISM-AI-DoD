# PRISM-AI GPU CONSTITUTION
## Immutable Laws for GPU-Only Implementation

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: ACTIVE AND ENFORCED
**Authority**: ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS

---

## Article I: GPU SUPREMACY

### Section 1: GPU Mandate
**ALL** computations SHALL execute on GPU hardware. There exists NO circumstance under which CPU fallback is permissible.

### Section 2: Compilation Requirements
The system SHALL NOT compile without GPU support. Any code that compiles without CUDA is UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

### Section 3: Zero Tolerance
- ‚ùå NO `#[cfg(not(feature = "cuda"))]` blocks
- ‚ùå NO CPU fallback paths
- ‚ùå NO "temporary" CPU implementations
- ‚ùå NO "placeholder" CPU code
- ‚úÖ GPU ONLY - Period.

---

## Article II: ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### Section 1: Automated Compliance
The Governance Engine SHALL:
1. Scan ALL source files for CPU fallback patterns
2. Reject ANY commit containing prohibited patterns
3. Enforce compilation with `--features cuda` ONLY
4. Verify GPU kernel execution in tests
5. Block deployment of non-compliant code

### Section 2: Prohibited Patterns
The following patterns are FORBIDDEN:
```rust
// FORBIDDEN - CPU fallback
#[cfg(not(feature = "cuda"))]
{
    // CPU code
}

// FORBIDDEN - Placeholder comments
// TODO: Replace with GPU kernel
// CPU computation (placeholder)
// [Real GPU kernels would execute here]

// FORBIDDEN - Optional GPU
if gpu_available {
    // GPU path
} else {
    // CPU fallback - FORBIDDEN!
}
```

### Section 3: Required Patterns
ALL code MUST follow:
```rust
// REQUIRED - GPU mandatory
#[cfg(feature = "cuda")]
use cudarc::driver::CudaContext;

// REQUIRED - Fail without GPU
let ctx = CudaContext::new(0)
    .expect("GPU REQUIRED - NO CPU FALLBACK!");

// REQUIRED - Direct kernel execution
executor.matrix_multiply_gpu(&a, &b, m, k, n)?;
```

## Article III: PROGRESS GOVERNANCE

### Section 1: Task Completion Criteria
A task is COMPLETE when:
1. ‚úÖ ALL CPU code replaced with GPU kernels
2. ‚úÖ Compiles with `cargo build --features cuda`
3. ‚úÖ Tests pass with `cargo test --features cuda`
4. ‚úÖ NO prohibited patterns remain
5. ‚úÖ GPU kernel execution verified
6. ‚úÖ Performance meets >1 GFLOPS threshold

### Section 2: Progress Tracking
The system SHALL:
1. Automatically update task status
2. Mark tasks complete ONLY when criteria met
3. Update progress percentages
4. Generate compliance reports
5. Block advancement until compliance

### Section 3: Continuous Verification
EVERY commit SHALL:
1. Pass CPU fallback detection
2. Compile successfully with CUDA only
3. Pass all GPU tests
4. Maintain or improve performance
5. Update progress documentation

---

## Article IV: IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Section 1: Module Requirements
EVERY module MUST:
1. Use GPU kernels for ALL computation
2. Fail gracefully without GPU (not fallback)
3. Report GPU execution status
4. Meet performance targets
5. Include GPU verification tests

### Section 2: Performance Standards
- **Minimum**: 1 GFLOPS sustained
- **Target**: 10+ GFLOPS for matrix operations
- **Goal**: >100 GFLOPS for optimized kernels

### Section 3: Memory Management
- Data SHALL remain on GPU between operations
- Host-device transfers SHALL be minimized
- Pinned memory SHALL be used for transfers
- GPU memory SHALL be managed explicitly

---

## Article V: GOVERNANCE ENGINE AUTHORITY

### Section 1: Absolute Power
The Governance Engine has ABSOLUTE authority to:
1. REJECT non-compliant code
2. BLOCK commits
3. HALT deployment
4. REQUIRE fixes
5. ENFORCE standards

### Section 2: No Override
There exists NO mechanism to override the Governance Engine. Compliance is MANDATORY.

### Section 3: Audit Trail
ALL actions SHALL be logged:
- Compliance checks performed
- Violations detected
- Commits blocked
- Tasks completed
- Performance metrics

---

## Article VI: MIGRATION MANDATE

### Section 1: Complete Migration Required
ALL modules SHALL be migrated to GPU:
1. ‚úÖ gpu_enabled.rs - Core tensor operations
2. ‚è≥ PWSA Active Inference Classifier
3. ‚è≥ Neuromorphic reservoir computing
4. ‚è≥ Statistical mechanics simulations
5. ‚è≥ Transfer entropy calculations
6. ‚è≥ Quantum state evolution
7. ‚è≥ Active inference engines
8. ‚è≥ Thermodynamic consensus
9. ‚è≥ Quantum voting
10. ‚è≥ Transfer entropy routing
11. ‚è≥ PID synergy decomposition
12. ‚è≥ CMA optimization algorithms
13. ‚è≥ LLM inference (local models)
14. ‚è≥ All novel algorithms
15. ‚è≥ All remaining modules

### Section 2: No Partial Migration
Modules are EITHER:
- ‚úÖ Fully GPU-accelerated
- ‚ùå Non-compliant and MUST be fixed

There is NO "partially GPU-accelerated" status.

---

## Article VII: AMENDMENTS

### Section 1: Amendment Process
This Constitution MAY be amended ONLY to:
1. Strengthen GPU requirements
2. Add stricter enforcement
3. Improve compliance mechanisms

### Section 2: Prohibited Amendments
This Constitution SHALL NOT be amended to:
1. ‚ùå Allow CPU fallback
2. ‚ùå Weaken GPU requirements
3. ‚ùå Create exceptions
4. ‚ùå Compromise on performance

## Article VIII: ENFORCEMENT

### Section 1: Immediate Effect
This Constitution takes effect IMMEDIATELY and applies to:
- All existing code
- All new code
- All future modifications
- All contributions

### Section 2: Compliance Deadline

- Week 1: Critical path (gpu_enabled, PWSA)
- Week 2: Core algorithms
- Week 3: Novel algorithms
- Week 4: Complete migration
- Week 5: Optimization and final verification

### Section 3: Consequences
