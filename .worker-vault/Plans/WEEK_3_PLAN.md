## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **GNN Complexity**: Start with simple architecture, expand iteratively
2. **Performance**: Profile early, optimize critical paths
3. **API Design**: Get early feedback, iterate

### Schedule Risks
1. **GNN Implementation Overrun**: Have fallback to simpler model
2. **Worker Dependencies**: Mocks in place, can proceed without

### Quality Risks
1. **Test Coverage**: Write tests alongside code
2. **Documentation**: Document as you build
