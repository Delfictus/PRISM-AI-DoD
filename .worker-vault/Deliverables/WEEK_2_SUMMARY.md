## Challenges Overcome

### Technical Challenges
1. **Type System Complexity**: Rust's trait system required careful handling of closures and lifetimes
   - Solution: Used `Box<dyn Fn>` for dynamic dispatch, explicit lifetime parameters

2. **Multi-Objective Algorithm**: NSGA-II has many intricate components
   - Solution: Modular implementation with clear separation of concerns

3. **Risk Calculations**: VaR/CVaR require statistical rigor
   - Solution: Implemented 3 methods (Historical, Parametric, Monte Carlo) for robustness

### Integration Challenges
1. **Upstream Test Failures**: 20 integration test failures in other modules
   - Resolution: Confirmed Worker 4 code is clean, issues are in upstream modules

2. **API Evolution**: Problem/Solution API changed during Week 2
   - Resolution: Updated all integration points, maintained backward compatibility where possible
