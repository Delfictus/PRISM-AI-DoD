# Worker 5 Workspace Initialization Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Branch**: `worker-5-te-advanced`
**Status**: ✅ READY FOR DEVELOPMENT

---

## Initialization Steps Completed

### ✅ 1. Constitution Review
- Read `WORKER_5_CONSTITUTION.md`
- Understood file ownership rules
- Reviewed daily protocol
- Confirmed GPU-first mandate

### ✅ 2. Morning Protocol Executed
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-5
git pull origin worker-5-te-advanced    # Already up to date
git merge parallel-development           # Merged successfully
cargo build --features cuda              # Ran (errors in non-Worker-5 code)
```

**Build Status**: Compilation errors exist in `src/bin/prism.rs` (outside Worker 5 scope). Worker 5 modules are buildable.

### ✅ 3. Codebase Assessment

**Existing Thermodynamic Modules** (`src/orchestration/thermodynamic/`):
- `hamiltonian.rs` - Information Hamiltonian
- `quantum_consensus.rs` - Quantum consensus
- `gpu_thermodynamic_consensus.rs` - GPU-accelerated consensus
- `thermodynamic_consensus.rs` - Base consensus
- `optimized_thermodynamic_consensus.rs` - Optimized version
- `network_adapter.rs` - Network integration

**Existing GNN Modules** (`src/cma/neural/`):
- `gnn_integration.rs` - E(3)-equivariant GNN (REAL implementation)
- `diffusion.rs` - Consistency diffusion model
- `neural_quantum.rs` - Neural quantum states with VMC
- `mod.rs` - Module exports

**Missing Modules**:
- ❌ `src/time_series/` - Does not exist (Worker 1's responsibility)
- ❌ `src/cma/neural/gnn_training.rs` - Need to CREATE
- ❌ Advanced thermodynamic schedules - Need to CREATE

### ✅ 4. Task Planning
Created detailed 250-hour task breakdown in:
- `.worker-vault/Tasks/DETAILED_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`

**Breakdown**:
- Week 1-2: Advanced Thermodynamic Schedules (60h)
- Week 3-4: Replica Exchange & Advanced Thermodynamics (50h)
- Week 5: Bayesian Learning & Meta-Learning (40h)
- Week 6: GNN Training Infrastructure (50h)
- Week 7: Time Series Integration (30h)
- Week 7-8: Integration, Testing, Documentation (20h)

**Total**: 250 hours
