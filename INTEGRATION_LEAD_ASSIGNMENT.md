## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 48 Hours)

### **Task 1: Monitor Worker 2 Critical Merge** (2-3 hours)

**Context**: Worker 2 has been issued URGENT instructions to merge kernel_executor.rs to deliverables.

**Your Actions**:

1. **Monitor progress**:
```bash
# Check if Worker 2 has completed the merge
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-2
cat KERNEL_MERGE_COMPLETE.txt 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Merge complete!" || echo "⏳ Waiting..."

# Check deliverables branch for updates
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD
git checkout deliverables
git pull origin deliverables
wc -l 03-Source-Code/src/gpu/kernel_executor.rs
# Should be ~3,456 lines after merge
```

2. **Once Worker 2 completes merge, verify build**:
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD/03-Source-Code
cargo build --lib 2>&1 | tee integration-build.log

# Count errors
grep "^error\[" integration-build.log | wc -l
# Should be 0 (or drastically reduced from 12)
```

3. **Document results**:
```bash
cat > /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/INTEGRATION_STATUS_$(date +%Y%m%d).md << 'EOF'
# Integration Status Report
**Date**: $(date)

## Worker 2 Kernel Executor Merge
- Status: [COMPLETE/IN PROGRESS/BLOCKED]
- Build Errors: [number]
- Next Steps: [description]

## Actions Taken
- [list actions]

## Blockers
- [list blockers or "None"]

EOF
```

### **Task 2: Set Up Integration Test Framework** (4-6 hours)

**Objective**: Create infrastructure for testing cross-worker functionality

**Step 1: Create integration test structure**
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD/03-Source-Code

# Create integration test directory if not exists
mkdir -p tests/integration

# Create integration test template
cat > tests/integration/test_cross_worker.rs << 'EOF'
//! Cross-Worker Integration Tests
//! Tests that verify multiple workers' code works together

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_worker1_worker2_gpu_integration() {
        // Test Worker 1 time series with Worker 2 GPU kernels
        // TODO: Implement
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_worker3_pixel_processing() {
        // Test Worker 3 PWSA pixel processing with Worker 2 GPU
        // TODO: Implement
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_worker5_llm_orchestration() {
        // Test Worker 5 Mission Charlie with Worker 6 LLM
        // TODO: Implement
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_api_server_endpoints() {
        // Test Worker 8 API with all backend modules
        // TODO: Implement
    }
}
EOF
```

**Step 2: Create automated test runner**
```bash
cat > tests/run_integration_tests.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Integration Test Runner
# Runs all integration tests and generates report

set -e

echo "================================"
echo "PRISM-AI Integration Test Suite"
echo "================================"
echo ""

# Build first
echo "Building project..."
cargo build --lib --all-features 2>&1 | tee build.log

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Build failed. See build.log"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Build successful"
echo ""

# Run unit tests
echo "Running unit tests..."
cargo test --lib 2>&1 | tee unit-tests.log

# Run integration tests
echo "Running integration tests..."
cargo test --test test_cross_worker 2>&1 | tee integration-tests.log

# Generate summary
echo ""
echo "================================"
echo "Test Summary"
echo "================================"
grep "test result:" unit-tests.log integration-tests.log

echo ""
echo "See detailed logs:"
echo "  - build.log"
echo "  - unit-tests.log"
echo "  - integration-tests.log"
EOF

chmod +x tests/run_integration_tests.sh
```

**Step 3: Test the framework**
```bash
cd /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-AI-DoD/03-Source-Code
bash tests/run_integration_tests.sh
```

---

### **Task 3: Create Integration Coordination Dashboard** (2-3 hours)

**Create a living document tracking all integration status**

```bash
cat > /home/diddy/Desktop/PRISM-Worker-8/INTEGRATION_DASHBOARD.md << 'EOF'
# PRISM-AI Integration Dashboard
