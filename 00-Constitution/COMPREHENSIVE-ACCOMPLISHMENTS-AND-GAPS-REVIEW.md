## WHAT'S ACTUALLY MISSING VS DEFERRED

### Missing (Should Add)

**For Mission Bravo:**
1. ❌ **BMC3 Interface** (mentioned in SBIR but not implemented)
   - Status: NOT STARTED
   - Effort: 1-2 weeks
   - Priority: MEDIUM (Phase II is acceptable)
   - Reason: SBIR Phase II deliverable, not Phase I

2. ❌ **Real Telemetry Integration** (live SDA data feed)
   - Status: Using synthetic data
   - Effort: 1 week (with SDA access)
   - Priority: LOW (synthetic is acceptable for demo)
   - Reason: Don't have SDA data access yet

3. ❌ **Multi-Level Security** (Secret/TopSecret enclaves)
   - Status: Encryption exists, enclaves don't
   - Effort: 2 weeks
   - Priority: LOW (unclassified demo sufficient)
   - Reason: Phase II extension

**For Mission Charlie:**
4. ⚠️ **Mission Bravo Integration** (CRITICAL GAP)
   - Status: NOT STARTED
   - Effort: 12 hours
   - Priority: CRITICAL (needed for SBIR demo)
   - Reason: This is what makes "multi-source fusion" real

5. ⚠️ **Basic Consensus Engine** (needed for demo)
   - Status: NOT STARTED
   - Effort: 16 hours
   - Priority: HIGH (demo quality)
   - Reason: Currently using simple average (works but not impressive)

---

### Deferred (Correct Decisions)

**Technical Debt (Mission Bravo):**
- Frame tracking, ML enhancements, etc. → Phase II
- **Reasoning:** Acceptable placeholders for v1.0
- **Impact:** ZERO on SBIR fundability

**ML Training (Enhancement 1):**
- Synthetic training → Skipped (correct)
- Real data training → Phase II
- **Reasoning:** No real data available, better to wait
- **Impact:** ZERO (framework sufficient for SBIR)

**Advanced Mission Charlie Features (Phases 2-6):**
- Full consensus, TE, privacy, etc. → Later
- **Reasoning:** Phase 1 sufficient for basic demo
- **Impact:** Can demo without these (nice-to-have)
